he's pretty good, what was his name, Ozzy, Ozzy, he was a free agent
I knew, but Ozzy couldn't get a call, it's true, he probably got a phone call
and said hey come and pick him up for us, Lance, yeah Lance
who did we have before that, Sir Shanks a lot, he booked Ozzy
we'll decide to pick him for the Cowboys now
he was good, he trained the Cowboys, he was good, I think he was
originally with Washington, I've never seen anybody miss 400 points
ever, I wonder what's going on in his head
what happens to him
he lost his playoff in 2011
anyway, we'll figure it out
the Lord be with you, and with thy spirit, let us pray
almighty and everlasting God, who by thy holy spirit didst preside in the council of the
blessed apostles, and hast promised through thy son Jesus Christ to be with thy
church to the end of the world, we beseech thee to be with this meeting of thy church
here assembled in thy name and presence, save us from all error, ignorance
and pride and prejudice, and of thy great mercy vouchsafe we
beseech thee so to direct, sanctify, and govern us in our work by thy
mighty power of the holy ghost, that the comfortable gospel of Christ may be
truly preached, truly received, and truly followed in all places
to the breaking down the kingdom of sin, Satan, and death, till at
length the whole of thy dispersed sheep, being gathered into one fold, shall
become partakers of everlasting life, through the merits and death of Jesus Christ
our savior, amen
rector's report
alright, well, happy new year to everyone
happy new year back at you, a couple
personnel updates right up at the top, Annie Sampson
as of today is now on maternity leave, baby Sampson is not here yet
but he or she will be here any moment, if you've seen her recently you know
the end is nigh, so keep them in your prayers
I know Josh is doing the dad stress thing right now
Elba Cox, she was the one who was doing the birthday card
ministry, been doing it for 14 years, she's decided
that she's had enough
and good for her, so Caroline actually volunteered to
take that over, so I'm excited for that
a couple things that we've done, we have two months since we didn't have
a business meeting in December, some visits, we've been doing a lot of visits
Kathy Compton Caputo fell
shattered her hip, but also
while in the hospital they discovered she has breast cancer
so she was in the hospital for some
time, she's home now, David's visited her a couple times, I visited her in the
hospital, Pudy Palmer had a couple
strokes and everything, she's doing better, I try and visit her
every other week or so, just to keep her
company and all that, she's in good spirits though. Is her daughter still living with her?
I don't know if she's, well she goes back and forth because she lives in Alexandria
so it's not that far, so she'll come stay for a few days, go to Alexandria
a few days, but she's close enough she can be back quickly, which is good
John Johnson is actually at the rehab facility right down the street from my house
so I've been able to visit him quite a bit, I go see him
on the way home from here most days and stuff, it's good to be able to sit with him
he's in good spirits, but he's definitely
declining, he's getting a lot of physical therapy right now because he was having
trouble just getting out of a chair.
Horst Langenstein also is someone I've been keeping an eye on
he had some real serious health problems like on Christmas day
and so I was talking with Marilyn and him quite a bit
I haven't really been to see him because they've both been exhausted from all the
ordeals that they've been through so they haven't really wanted to visit, but he and I
exchange phone calls and everything and I will visit him as soon as possible
he actually continues to go to Brightview most weeks, I fill in for him sometimes
but he's really got a nice congregation there
some great ladies and some gentlemen now too
in fact, yeah, so that's good
and then we've been doing house blessings
over the past few weeks which have been going really well, it's really fun
to do that, so that's good. Some services that we did, the vendor
one more health thing, Lynn Bender
he's on his death bed
the treatments that they've been doing have
done well, the last PET scan he had
was lower than the one before
he of course got to see his son get married, which was the big thing
and he said he gets cold
a lot, just because his body is so
ragged with all the chemo, but he's doing remarkably well
he looks really good. He's coming to men's group tomorrow
oh, that's wonderful. So yeah, so November 19th was the
wedding, it was sort of their second time, because remember
they moved it up so that he could be there, and then he got double pneumonia
and so he couldn't be there, but he was able to make the one he wasn't supposed to make
that's the most preferable option, I think
we also had a funeral for John Metkin, most people don't seem to
remember or to have known John, but I was talking with him a lot
towards the end there, did a funeral for his wife last year
he hung on for about a year, but he passed
at Lessons and Carols we had a pretty successful evening
we had about 67 people here, as far as I counted, and then
between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we had about 140-ish
which was good. January 11th
I did a funeral for a guy named Eric Esker
who is Shirley Colligan's son-in-law
so Shirley goes to the 8 o'clock service
that was her daughter Sandy, so Cheryl Lynn's sister
he passed, he had Alzheimer's, pretty advanced Alzheimer's, so we did his funeral
it was actually a joint service with a Roman Catholic priest who is his
brother, older brother, so it was very interesting. Ecumenical affair
Were Jim and
Cheryl up for that? I didn't see them Sunday at the
church. No, they were up for the funeral
and then January 15th, which was Sunday, we did Winter Relief, which was a big
success. Kathy and Dwight were there and a number of other folks were there
which was really, really nice. A couple things that we are
working on right now, just for you to be aware of, we've got our newcomers class this Saturday
I've gotten some really good feedback as far as turnout for that
we've done these over the past few years, but I think with COVID and everything
it just wasn't great turnout, but we have a really good mix of some newer
folks and some older folks who have been here for a while and I think it'll be a really
good group, so I'm excited for that. Our Friday Bible
study started this past week and we had a great turnout for that as well. We probably had
I don't know, maybe 17, 18, something like that. It was crowded. We had to
add more tables. We did, we did. That's always a good problem to have. Thursday Bible study
starts this week. How is Hugh?
Hugh is good, Hugh is good. She was cleared to bring him on Sunday
but with the wind and it being cold, she didn't want to take him out
He's having trouble hearing. And he also is having trouble hearing. When I talk to him
on the phone, he's using a speaker phone and he can hear then
but face-to-face, of course I haven't been face-to-face with him, but
we visited him and he is a little
you have to speak loudly. He's bothered by it as well. So he doesn't
wear hearing aids? Yes, he's in the process.
But it's like my father. It doesn't matter. He still has to say things three times
and yell. Sometimes it's selective hearing. That's pretty good.
But I think he's doing great. When I talk to him on the phone, it's kind of like
the old Hugh. And to see her this past Sunday
that was very nice.
When I went to visit him and then I think when you went to visit him
after I did, he definitely looked much better than I'd seen
him looking for some time, which was great.
Let's see. Just a couple things coming up. We've got our
retreat coming up on February 18th about the canticles
that we use at morning and evening prayer. I think that will be really fun.
Ash Wednesday is very soon. February 22nd.
I saw a picture
of a priest leaned over like
this and somebody with a chair behind him and it says priest after Christmas and then
Ash Wednesday. So that will be here before we know it.
We'll have another retreat for the spring retreat probably sometime
in March or April and then first week of April is Holy Week
this year. That's pretty much all I have.
What about the Elliott Society?
I wouldn't count that because it's not something we're doing but it is something I would encourage people
and it's a good thing for us to know that they're doing that.
Definitely a good enrichment opportunity.
April 24th is the clergy conference. April 23rd.
That's when you and I will leave after church.
Where is that this year? The beach.
Ocean City? No, North Carolina beach.
Admiral Isle. That's right, where Caroline and I went on our honeymoon.
Ten years ago.
This time we'll be sharing a room.
That's how things change.
You said that.
Caroline knows this.
You have to have separate rooms.
Especially now. I have to practice my snoring.
You don't need to practice it.
Okay.
Secretary's report.
I know I threw everybody off by getting the draft
out to you after only five days.
Johnson said it looked fine to him and I heard nothing else.
I was impressed. I was in shock.
Get it out of the way.
Lorraine is back, right?
Lorraine is back.
I saw her and I welcomed her back.
She ran the other way.
She did.
Okay, well, there being
no corrections, the minutes stand approved as submitted.
Treasurer's report.
I just re-ran the projected
pledge again for this year and I'm at $105,000.
By comparison, that's for the whole year.
By comparison, it was $160,000 I think last year.
Usually the money that this comes in
from whomever about balances with the pledge payment.
So it was $160,000, $160,000, $320,000.
If this is true, then we're going to end up at $210,000.
We've got to lay off the priest, we've got to lay off the deacon. That's where we're at.
So you're saying that this time last year the pledges were $160,000.
Yes, sir. And this year it's $105,000.
Last group of people, I got three more pledge sheets.
Somebody just wanted envelopes, but nevertheless.
Do you know how many pledging units that is?
How many people have pledged?
I haven't counted them. I've got a whole folder which I can give to you and you can look at.
I've been trying to figure out.
We've had people leave, we've had people die.
Our main donors are still here.
They haven't gone anywhere.
Not this last week, but the previous week we had really good attendance, I thought.
It was better last week.
I'm hoping that people are coming back now because I'm trying to figure out
I gave you that list, but there's a lot of
There's one other list I was going to give you, but it's a nonsense list because
Gretchen, what's her last name?
She doesn't have a pledge statement.
She doesn't pledge anything, but she gives a lot of money to us.
Every week.
I like to have a list report. It's no good because you're going to go down and say, well, Gretchen
Hey, there's people, they don't do the pledge forms.
They don't do the envelopes, but they give you money. Gretchen's an example of that.
Valentine's, I don't remember when we went to the Valentine's, but I think they're the same way.
They give a tremendous amount of money to us, and they're not
showing up in this hundred. That's how you get balance.
It's about a 50-50 between people that pledge, and most everybody
makes their pledge number. I didn't.
Now, compared to last year, how many more pledges do you receive
after the end of the year?
Maybe January, that's it.
People still don't come up and say, hey, I want envelopes.
I don't know why. I don't know what the deal is.
I haven't gone down and figured it out analytically. Who am I missing here?
Like the lenses, for example. They're pretty steady with theirs.
They had checks that came.
A hundred bucks a week or something, not a hundred bucks, maybe a hundred bucks every two weeks
or something like that. So 2,600, let's say,
that we're missing because of them going to wherever they're going to.
But I can't see any big
hitters that we're missing unless
people have died or people have
gone off to other places. I don't know. I know we have some people going to other churches
because they don't like the liturgy. For whatever reason, I can't figure it out.
But then I'm a lay guy. I don't know. What do I know?
I don't really see a difference from what you're doing or what's been going on here for 20 years.
Except, you know, you print this stuff out now.
Yeah, I mean, it's stupid. Oh my God, he's got
Latin in there. There's Latin words there. Oh my God, it's Catholic.
There's Latin in the prayer book, too.
But anyway, that's that.
And when Johnson sent that to me last week,
I took the 2017 membership
list, compared it to the 2021 membership list, and Annie
had just run a new one, 2023.
We have had, since 2017, 27 deaths.
19 of those are total, you know, both people
have died or they've moved because one person died.
The general rule, too, and even if they don't move, I mean,
priests will tell you this, if one spouse dies and they both
were coming to church, you often do lose both.
Not all the time, but a lot of the time.
There was one update list.
Yes, I remember that. So 27 people have either moved or died?
No, that's died.
I mean, it's Albie Bacon, Louise Blount, Barbara Carr, Randall Carroll, Jenny Kroll.
I mean, they were all, I don't think there was one that I didn't know.
But Jenny, I will just not die.
Died and moved.
Gary, 13 other families have moved.
So they are no longer
in the area. So that's a total of 40 people right there.
Or 40 potential pledges that we no longer have.
But compared to...
What's the number compared to last year?
I don't have last year's.
Last year we had pledges of $160,000 more or less.
And this year we got $105,000.
Because somebody is watching over us, this is going to work out.
I don't have full confidence in that, but I'd be interested to know what the difference is between last year and this year.
Because it's much more current.
It's just like, how many Tall and the Smiths have been coming here?
Not that long, three or four years. Versus five years ago, they weren't here.
Now they're here and they're big donors.
I also wrote down all the new names that weren't on the 2017 list.
That's the longest line here.
The people that I know that are active, Honor, Lorraine Lipka, Pat and Jim McDonough,
the Ohlmeyers, the Sampsons, Roland and Joan,
the Walkers, Jim and Judy, Denise Bunting, Steve Johnson.
I'm sure there are more people that
11 o'clock or 8 o'clock would know that I don't.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to make you aware, that's all.
Outside of that, there's nothing exciting going on.
One question, too, that helps put it in perspective a little bit.
Looking at the reports, it didn't seem like there was any major fluctuation
in the last three months. November was kind of a tough month.
We've kind of gone like this.
That's why I was encouraged by the last couple Sundays to get more people in the church.
Because I just look around on Sundays and go, oh my God, there's nobody here.
We're lucky to get 20 people in the seats.
Now the last two weeks, it's up. I'm encouraged by that.
I noticed for the 11 o'clock,
it's the choir.
I wonder about the 930.
People donate as well. He says 20 in the seats, add 15 to that.
930 is about the same.
What's weird about 930 is
they've always been artificially subsidized by the Hope House people.
Before COVID and they're bringing 12 people,
you get 35, 36, 40 maybe.
But when they stop coming and you take that 12, 15 away,
it does feel a little bit more empty, that service.
But as far as the number of members who attend that service, it's relatively the same.
I just wondered if for all three services...
8 o'clock, they fluctuate. The past few weeks, again,
there's been an uptick. My family was going to 8 o'clock for a long time.
So there's three extras.
And they moved to 11.
That's the only thing I look at.
So that's all there are.
Everything else is the same. The bills are paid.
Although I'm on strike about paying bills for the next 10 days.
If something happened and we needed to write a check, we can't, right?
You'll have to put it on a credit card.
He's got the big credit card right here.
I gave you the check, so you got them.
I don't have any other bills. And if you look out there, my slot's empty.
I don't know.
I got a thing from Schulte, but he's not going to get paid until I get back.
So I got one I'm not sure what to do with.
And then I've got one from Elva for her last thing of buying cards and stuff.
So I have to reimburse her for that.
But it's just like, where are the bills going?
Like Verizon. Or not Verizon. Comcast. Where is it?
The hogs ate them?
You just wonder about if you're getting the bills on time.
Did we get it in paper?
It's on Uber that you are automatically put in paperless unless you opted out.
Is that Verizon?
Not Verizon. Comcast?
I get my bill at home from Comcast, so I know it's electronic.
But most of my stuff's electronic now.
What email would it go to?
That's an excellent question.
I am on a lot of the bills so that they come to me.
And I check the junk pile and trash.
I check them every day when I'm going down through there because sometimes
I get the Babylon Bee, for example, shows up in trash sometimes
which irritates me because I like to read the Babylon Bee.
It's a paper of record.
Funny guys. Funny, funny, funny.
It's not as funny as it used to be
because it's all coming true.
A lot of people on the Bee, they say, this ain't satire, this is real.
Any other discussion on finances?
One last thing. I'm leaving Saturday and I'll be back on the 31st.
I'll be in Heaton.
As long as I don't kill the pit bulls, so the pit bulls don't kill me.
I'm not sure.
Since there are no corrections, the financial reports are approved
and submitted. Junior Warden.
That's a hard one to follow when I'm asking for money.
If you haven't
noticed, we're getting more and more and more
things going on in the hall.
It's like every week there's
things and unfortunately we're running out of room
for storage of items, crockpots, etc.
There's two options that I've come up with. One
is to just haul that stuff out into the shed and when
they need it, go out to the shed, schlep it here and whatever.
I was told, pillow talk, that
that wasn't the right thing to do.
What was her solution?
Upper cabinets
over there. On that blank wall
above the counter. Short of getting
a cupboard that is just stand-alone.
It's just a band-aid. We wouldn't have any place to put a
stand-alone cupboard anyway.
You put a corner cabinet there and then just wall cabinets there.
And that was your wife's suggestion? We have a replacement.
Step right in.
She was talking with Clint's wife and Lauren was the one that came up
with that idea.
Can you match the stuff that they've got there already?
Close. That's an Expresso I believe.
They just started out that way.
It's not custom painted so we should be able to match it.
I am
at the most
I got a lot of cabinets
that we did our kitchen. They're from the
RTA store. Ready to assemble.
They're all plywood boxes.
They're dovetail drawers. The drawers are all put together.
But you basically just put the carcasses together.
We've had it for well over ten years. Never had
an issue with it. So that's where I would go.
A 36 by 36 wall cabinet here.
388 by 58.
So if you're looking at one, two,
three and a half, you're probably looking
less than $2,000 if you get spacers
to fill in whatever on there.
36s?
It'll be a 36 in the corner, I'm sure, and then two 36s
and maybe an 18 or something.
This way and this way?
Yes, that way there to the end.
And you'll need more than nine, less than twelve.
I just got a pull down
cabinet on top of the microwave for Susan
because she's vertically impaired.
And she loves it.
The thing to do is to store most of the stuff you don't want normally.
Exactly. But again, I'm constantly
finding that people have bowls, they have spoons,
they have coffee makers, they've got all kinds of things that they just
leave there and you can tell that they're bachelors because
they don't realize that it doesn't get cleaned up.
I wonder how much of it too.
Was that an indirect?
Should we tell them though?
Oh yeah, I'm not going to be a bachelor forever.
Much longer probably.
What's his name?
Does he snore?
Does she know?
This was the young lady who was here last month.
I was going to say something then, but since it was her first time visiting with us, I didn't want to say,
Hey!
It's like the first time you go for dinner somewhere.
Why don't you come on over and go to church?
Congratulations.
Circling all the way back.
Does it make sense? I don't know, but is it possible that we have too much stuff?
I shouldn't speak because I...
A little clean out?
Carol went through all of that
When we do our pancake breakfast, we use
everything that we have. When we do these potlucks,
we use 99% of what we have.
It's like the in-betweens that we don't have.
Remember we used all the pitchers for the pancake batter last year?
We don't need those for most of the year.
I just was wondering if there was...
And they do have
on Patreon, they have a Kingerigger
for on sale.
Anyway, I would like to bring up that
we put upper cabinets on there sooner rather than later.
If we're worried about dollars
and off the record for this,
Susan and I will pay for the cabinets, and when we get
money, pay us back. I don't have a problem with that.
Real quickly, we're running right now, we've got $135,000
in the bank, and I've got $90,000 invested in T-bills
and savings bonds and stuff, so we're not going broke.
I'm just looking down the road and seeing...
Are you ready for a motion?
That we install three and a half cabinets.
Not to exceed $2,000.
Is this the appropriate time to be doing this here, Senior Warden?
No. I mean, it's actually new business, but
we've gone this far, so just go with it.
Well, it's a Junior Warden's report.
There you go.
Say everybody?
Hang on. Just so everybody knows, we did budget
$15,000 for building maintenance.
Or if this is major
building expense, we budgeted $8,000.
We can make this major.
It's not major.
The thing is, I've got it from a macro level. I've got $135,000
in the bank and $90,000 in investments.
I don't worry too much about how we divvy the money up.
If we don't take it out of major building...we haven't taken anything out of major building, I think,
since we did the roof. And money comes in every week
into the building fund. Every week. And the maintenance crack
comes out of general. Just so you know.
So it is a major building.
We're adding to the building, so that's cool.
Is there any more discussion? All those in favor
of building the cabinets?
Is that unanimous? Opposed?
Motion carried. Item last is
facility cleaning.
We just went with a new company
because the old company was not doing a good job.
This is the ones that said they couldn't see the cobwebs
because they came when it was dark.
This time, we
had the first...I met with...
Who are they now? Coverall.
Which we had. I don't think they like you very much, do they?
No, they actually do. Because the guy that was the
old person is no longer there. You can't speak about old people like that.
No, true.
No longer there is enough to know.
It's like dead and moved at the same time.
So anyway, that being said, they came
once. Did an okay job. Again, new broom sweeps
clean. They came the second time and
all of the lights were left on. They came on Saturday afternoon.
Lights were left on. All of the trash
save for Father West's office was emptied.
But there were papers everywhere.
The toilet brush was knocked over.
They left their own cleaning supplies out here. There's papers on the floor.
It was awful.
I sent him a nasty gram. I copied Coverall on that.
He calls me up and he tells me,
I'm sorry, I just wasn't myself yet.
I'm thinking, I don't care.
Worse than that, he goes, I had people that weren't my regular cleaning crew
with me and I don't know what happened. I'm thinking, well, well, back up. I didn't say anything.
You were bonded for your people and if you have friends
of yours coming in here with keys
on. So I don't want to ask this question
but I think I have to.
Andrea's daughter has been after us
since... John needs work.
No, this isn't John.
And apparently that's what she does
is cleaning.
I'd like to be able to tell these people
you're not coming back. We're not paying you for last week.
Give me my keys and we'll start over with somebody else.
But the problem is that
like it was with John Welch, they're parishioners.
And if we get into that, we theoretically
have an issue.
Which daughter is it? I don't know.
Because Caitlin George is her
niece or daughter.
There's three daughters.
Sometimes and once on the blue moon.
Not to correct you, but I will correct you. When was the last time
you saw John? They come to 8 o'clock.
How many times?
They haven't been in the past couple weeks.
He was here for midnight mass.
Wait a minute. What's the concern?
It's harder to fire them.
The concern is if she does a crappy job
What's that going to do to Andrea?
Somebody has to have that conversation.
I don't have a problem talking to her about that.
But do we want to open that door?
It's like borrowing money from a friend.
I talked a little bit with Kathy.
Maybe we make it clear. We put her on a six month trial.
And then that gives us a door
for that.
The guy that came that didn't feel like himself.
He's a subcontractor to Coverall.
He's new with Coverall.
Would it make sense to
go back to Coverall and say, look, we don't want this guy.
Do you have somebody else or should we just cease and desist now?
That's a possibility. I don't have a problem with that
conversation.
They did a decent job.
We don't pay for decent.
Did we sign a contract with Coverall?
He said that to an attorney.
Did they violate the contract by bringing in
non-Covered people?
They just got signed up to break the contract.
They didn't do a good job.
They broke the contract.
That's also a five letter word.
Coverall is who we do business with.
I agree.
If they give us somebody else and we just tell them,
fine, we're not doing it anymore. I just don't feel comfortable
with this guy being here and not even worrying about
bringing his friends in here.
We're getting rid of him.
We wanted to talk about the what ifs.
Is there an issue or do we want to just bring this
back up again if we need to?
Given Coverall the chance, if you have
somebody who can handle this properly,
a professional, we would continue to do business
with you. If not, we'll terminate right now. If you send
me one more person who doesn't do it, we will terminate
then. Where do we stand?
That's good.
The part
is ordered for the
HVAC unit for the chapel. That is a
switching valve or something that was wrong with that.
That's why I was turning off and on.
Oh, yeah.
The other thing
is they're coming to, after four or five months,
finally Absolute is coming to repack
the water pump for the fire system.
That was back in July of immediate concern
and had to be addressed right away.
Along that line,
just from
grounds,
the garden pavers are in. If you haven't seen them, please take a look.
We did not, she did not power wash the old
stones because the water is turned off.
We didn't want to turn the water on, have the guy come out, turn the water on, have him come
back out, turn the water off and come back again and spray. She knows that as soon
as the water goes on, she will power wash the old pavers
and the old columbarium. Other than that, the job is done.
We did move the sundial so that you could get to the new
columbarium. Rather than disrupt the circle
that's in the middle, we put the sundial right in the
corner of summer. So the circle will be unbroken?
The circle will be unbroken.
Now, but what about
Ann's ashes, where are they?
Ann's ashes, where are they?
I think they're in a niche.
I have no idea. I was just thinking about what we think about.
This was a big conversation back then.
Sky king lunch box.
John,
she can have water done. We have the hose sitting right out here and it will reach
the garden easy. We've had it out across the driveway before.
Can't she just use that? She's just power washing, right?
Can't she use a hose hooked up to it?
I don't know.
If you want it done.
It should be fine.
It was done with that in mind.
That charges the whole sprinkler system.
If we turned that on and charged it, we'd have to have it blown out again.
At the behind
Ann's chair.
If you're talking about the one that's right outside the door here.
All the drug guys come down and use it to get water and stuff.
If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for the place.
Moving right along, from a committee standpoint,
I didn't get anything from altar guild, cemetery,
mention ed youth activity.
Finance committee, nothing. Coffee hour seems to be going along.
Hospitality, father already mentioned, we'll do Shrove Tuesday.
We'll have the pancake dinner here again.
We'll get with Joan and get that lined up.
From the ladies guild, they were able to sponsor
a family at Christmas.
A $250 gift card.
So they could use it anywhere.
We had our epiphany party
last Saturday, the 7th.
Decent turnout, not spectacular.
February 18th is our next meeting at 10 a.m.
March 18th, Ken Sable is going to
do a talk about his trip to the Holy Land
and that will be sponsored by the guild.
And on April 15th, it's the annual guild tea party.
Tea for two.
The guild is moving right along and we're going to start getting more advertising out
because the epiphany party didn't get advertised as soon as it should have.
Due to people probably having COVID and being sick
from Christmas and everything else.
There were some people who said, oh, I wish I had known sooner I would have come.
We will start, I think Angela already sent it to you
so you can get it on the calendar and in the bulletin and all that stuff.
Missions, Laura
is looking, we're still carrying forward a $15,000
balance from last year. They pretty much spent everything
they've been given this year, but the fund carryover
from last year was $15,000 and I've talked to Laura
about that and I've told her you're not supposed to be carrying
well, she can carry a little bit to cover the
expenses for, we sent $400 to Salvation Army
and so forth, so she needs to carry maybe three months worth of
carryover, but this is much more and so she is
going to have
a committee meeting and seriously address
just what they should do with the excess money and how do they want to use it.
Just so you keep that up. Scholarship,
nothing to report. Stewardship? Nothing from
stewardship, but as far as strategic planning is concerned
the two places that I've solicited bids for for the parking
just never responded. And in light of what
we talked about earlier, I just would feel very uncomfortable committing
$35,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 to a
project at this point. Good move.
And we did the flagstone that
wasn't in the garden, we did not
get rid of it, it is now stored behind the
Sunday School building, because apparently that stuff costs a fortune.
It does. So we've got, we've saved all of that.
So we'll have that available
for whatever.
Old building, I've already told you about the pavers
in the garden.
Bylaw, canna, vestry, haven't done any more on that. One of these
days we will get back together and work on that. It occurred to me that
it might be useful to have the secretary involved in that, so I'll volunteer
to participate. Okay. When you get around to it.
I will add you. Add David.
Okay.
I'm assuming no update. Johnson, you
always sit right there.
Nothing me up.
If you want I can act like that.
Nothing.
Kind of a nasty
grin from somebody, Ann Rundle, was basically I already told you that
you can't have one. Okay. So I haven't done a thing on it.
Have we talked about
could we just look into getting a nice sign that's not electronic
with the funds? What are you going to do with a sign that doesn't have
electrics on it? We've got one that's out there.
Where we rebuild it so that people could see it and it was bigger?
Well you know the thing is, if you turn that rock over, according to the people at the
county, we've got too many signs.
And it has to be a certain size, right?
Well I forget how big it is.
We could just improve what we have.
I was talking to Pat and Patrick
and he says why don't you just put it in and see if they notice.
Well apparently they didn't notice at the fairgrounds.
Oh they brought that up. That's a different story.
The fairgrounds, thank you, are not
a historic landmark. The street is.
I'm sorry, this is where we go back to them saying
that we couldn't have a historical marker because
I haven't done that yet. Because the church had been altered.
So that's why it's our own marker.
So when they say we're a historic building, it's like well if we're a historic building you wouldn't give us a historic
so what is it? Just take us off the list. It's not that big of a deal.
It doesn't draw 100 people a year.
It is unofficially a historic building.
Well I got the nasty gram
from who said it's a historic landmark and I've already told you this
and you can't have an electronic sign a historic landmark.
Well I'll come back and I'll try that.
But George Washington went to confession there.
I'll try that. He said I cannot tell a lie.
That's where it happened. The other thing we can ask Myron
unless somebody else knows around what
year we were putting in the, because Myron got the marker
to put up. And we can go back to the original
Since I started coming to church
Bishop Bob was still here. He was still director.
I came 10 years ago. And we had a little ceremony.
In the photos there's a picture
It's got to have been
We should have paperwork somewhere.
It's probably after 2007.
We have to make it 2007. I've organized all the minutes
This building went up in 2007 or
2008 or something like that.
I started coming to this church between my mother's death and my father's death.
Was it only the chapel when you started?
Cindy when did we build this thing?
I did.
2006
Something like that.
2004-07
You pledged money for a 3 year period
2008 is what our Wikipedia says
which is never wrong.
Of course.
The first 5 or 6 years I was here all we had was the chapel.
That's the same with us.
2003
This is when we broke the landmark stuff?
When did they do that?
That was our parish hall.
We would have gotten a building permit to do that.
The county can tell us.
Isn't the altar in the chapel an extension of the original?
You could even go back to that.
That's like 1871 when they pushed that chancel in there.
The priest did it all by himself.
He just started tearing it out.
Which we take as a precedent.
That's practically canon law now.
Someday if you see some construction going on
in the chapel, that door up there
where you guys hang out.
There's a door that's like this by this.
You have sun to the altar.
It's huge.
You could stand up in that thing.
It's huge.
Anything on the investment policy statement?
No.
Wording for the plaque?
Sunday school building clean out.
I think Lance pretty much finished it.
It's just that it's in need of aiding.
The bins are pretty much out of there.
There's still a ton of stuff.
There's tables, there's chairs.
It looks like an altar.
A little tiny side table altar.
I think it was for instructing kids.
Jude could be the rector up there.
Yeah.
Rowan is the one who said, hold on.
New business.
Landscape.
I've invited two people to give us a quote that would match the agreement that we had with
South River, whom I think is out of business.
I can't be sure of that, but they're not responding to any contact that I made.
It turns out that the woman that we're working with
works with one of the companies that I have invited.
I'm not going to talk to them about that. I don't want to put that in a difficult light.
The other company that I've invited is Brightview. I just don't know when they'll be able to provide that.
Certainly before we meet next time.
Looking forward, I forgot her name.
Joey Horton.
The Custom Cuts is the name of the other company that she works with on a daily basis.
That might not be a bad thing.
Should she then move on, then we would have a relationship automatically with Custom Cuts.
True Green does it as well, so it's not a bad thing.
Brightview is True Green's biggest commercial account.
They're much larger. They're nationwide, as True Green is.
It's handled on a smaller scale locally.
I expect that the quote would be higher than what we're getting from Joey.
Let's at least give it a chance and see what happens.
I don't want to say she's not reliable, but they are very reliable.
That's why she uses the Custom Cuts.
She knows with the number of churches and jobs
that she has, she can't commit to getting out
here once a week during the growing season.
That's what Custom Cuts does. They've worked together.
The reason I chose them is because it's a local small business.
They want to keep their money at home.
As I said, Brightview is quite large, but we'll see what they come through with.
Shrove Tuesday,
Father already mentioned, is February 21st. Any other new business?
Any concerns?
Thoughts?
All right. Closing prayer. The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Almighty and everlasting God,
hear our prayers and grant to this parish all things necessary for its spiritual well-being.
Enlighten and guide our leaders, our clergy, wardens, and vestry.
Strengthen and increase the faithful. Visit and relieve the sick.
Turn and renew the hard-hearted or careless. Bring again those who have wandered.
Remove from us anything that resists your grace or hinders your purposes.
Give us one united voice to sing your praises and to give witness to your goodness
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Meeting adjourned.
He wants me to move to Houston, but I don't want to hear about Houston
or Harris County.
Yeah. Yeah.
