news about the pilgrimage about three days ago, Margie texted me and said we had 10 people
and we need 20 by like pretty soon. And so Margie, Dave, and I were talking about, you
know, okay well I guess it's not going to happen. And then the next day we had eight
hour. So looks like it may happen. Just that's the way it is. So I was starting to, I was
starting to re-plan my October. Anyway, so it looks like we will be going, some of us.
Anyway, I told you that we're going to be looking at what's called the itinerary of
the spiritual life. So the itinerary of the spiritual life is threefold in the tradition
of the church. You see it in the west, you see it in the east. Some spiritual writers
have take issue with the notion of stages because they say oh we shouldn't even worry
about stages and maybe there aren't even stages and you know all we have to do is just follow
Christ and well that's a little simplistic and you know following Christ of all the apostles
they didn't follow him equally. None of them have the same, they don't just like have one
level in heaven of apostles. They all have different spots according to their own conformity
with the heart of Christ. Okay and so this is going to be by degrees and tradition has
always looked at this from pseudo Dionysius in the fourth century and Augustine, Aquinas,
John of the cross and in the east as well. They always look at three stages of the spiritual
life. Three stages of the spiritual life and you know they may have in the east they'll
have certain names that do not exactly correspond to the same names but the content is the same.
It's just a marketing thing. Okay so you know the Greeks call it one thing, the desert fathers
call it another and in the west the Latins say purgative, illuminative, and unitive.
So we'll just follow as Roman Catholics we'll just follow the western parlance. Okay so
the purgative way. Saint John Paul the second says those who live by the flesh experience
God's law as a burden and indeed as a denial or at least a restriction of their own freedom.
On the other hand those who are impelled by love and walk by the spirit and who desire
to serve others find in God's law the fundamental and necessary way in which to practice love
as something freely chosen and freely lived out. Indeed they feel an interior urge a genuine
necessity and no longer a form of coercion not to stop at the minimum demands of the
law but to live them in their fullness. This is a still uncertain and fragile journey as
long as we are on earth but it is one made possible by grace which enables us to possess
the full freedom of the children of God and thus to live our moral life in a way worthy
of our sublime vocation as sons in the sun. So that's number 18 from Veritatis Splendor.
Which you know is a clarity of that document of the whole document is really refreshing
today and you know back then there were on moral theological faculties you know their
hair was on fire because John Paul the second was laying down a natural law and law of grace
that do not change and that are the same for everyone and so this was you know for relativists
for modernists for those who have pretty much sucked out everything supernatural from their
so called Catholic identity you know this is a cold shower. I wanted to approach these
stages through the lens of John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila. Today it's going to be
a little more Teresa next week next time. Our next talk on the purgative way we're going
to look a little more at John of the Cross and it's fascinating the complementarity that
you find there you know obviously both from the same school the Carmelites and you know
the Carmelites have such a beautiful spirituality and you know as members of the Saint Veronica
Giuliani community we have John of the Cross as one of our heavenly protectors and he was
chosen for a reason. The reason is his doctrine. We want him for his doctrine. Thomas Aquinas
says for at first it is incumbent on man to occupy himself chiefly with avoiding sin and
resisting his concupiscence which moves him in opposition to charity. This concerns beginners
in whom charity has to be fed or fostered lest it be destroyed. So Thomas Aquinas when
he's talking about the three ways he also says that in the purgative stage these people
are in a precarious situation. But let's see even before we get to say the first interior
castle of Saint Teresa of Avila. You know Saint Teresa of Avila had what's called an
intellectual vision. There are three types of visions okay there's corporeal vision there's
imaginative vision and there's intellectual vision. They're very very distinct. The corporeal
vision is think of the resurrection of our Lord and his resurrected body united to his
soul is appearing okay and that's how you can eat fish okay. If you didn't have a body
you wouldn't have a mouth to put it in right so it's pretty clear and one of the differences
with a with a corporeal vision you know you close your eyes you blink and you don't see
him you open your eyes and he's still there and casting a shadow in fact okay that's a
corporeal vision bodily. Then there's the imaginative vision not imaginary like something
I've concocted or I'm a hysteric okay but imaginative means that God impresses an image
on the intellect directly bypassing the external senses. So there's no external body. Many
of the visionaries say in a Bernadette of Lord she saw her lady nobody else did was
she there of course she was it was an imaginative vision not imaginary okay she didn't concoct
this herself she didn't come up with it because she was an emotionally weak person okay. Our
Lord impresses the image of the Blessed Mother on her intellect directly so that she can
see and even hear the words okay so it's it's a more direct vision that's called imaginative.
Now those are the more common when we see this in the lives of of mystics but also in
the lives of people who are fooled by the evil one counterfeit visions that's that's
the type that the devil's finds very easy to do of all the three that's the easiest
for the devil to counterfeit or to replicate. So is that clear the distinction between corporeal
and imaginative? Then there's the one that I think is kind of a little sounds like a
misnomer right it's because it's called an intellectual vision so there's no body there's
no external body that the visionary is seeing there's also no image impressed on the intellect.
What is there there's a concept infused into the intellect a concept with absolute clarity
of understanding and that's because there is no image to interpret there's no body to
try and figure out it's so it's so when when there is an intellectual vision there's absolute
clarity about its meaning there's just no doubt and we learn you know Aristotle says
there's nothing in the mind that wasn't first in the senses well he didn't know about intellectual
visions okay he just didn't know about that he was a pagan so he's outside of the whole
system of grace. So the reason I made these distinctions is because Teresa of Avila had
an intellectual vision of the interior castle she had an intellectual vision of her own
soul having these concentric circles and at the center was Christ from which all the light
came and as it went to the outer you know fifth fourth third second first you know the
most exterior castle the lighter the light is less less bright closer you get to the
seventh mansion obviously the brighter it is because there's the immediate contact with
the Lord. Now outside Teresa distinguishes between two types of souls outside of the
interior castles those who are hardened sinners those people who have are obstinate in sin
and that you know obviously there's a whole spectrum of people that are obstinate in sin
could be somebody who just says I don't want to you know I don't need the church I go walk
through the fields on Sundays and that's how I commune well I mean that's obstinate in
sin right it's not the same as somebody who says well I'm not a Catholic and I don't go
to mass because I'm a Satanist okay I mean those are not equal people but they're both
obstinate in their sin it's just a different flavor okay one is a little more bitter than
the other obviously but these are different flavors but then you've got those who are
very close kind of what we would call them creasters for the cultural Christians who
are very close Christian Christmas and Easter right they're very close to the wall so they're
um say you know you find a lot of these people who you know I all the time you know hey I
was an altar boy you know they kind of there's a certain affect effective relationship with
them they don't haven't renounced their faith but they're you know they're not really living
it right but there is there isn't they haven't cut with it right there isn't a there isn't
a volitional intellectual thought out apostasy okay but they're still you know in great danger
right because they're outside of the castle then you enter into the first mansion of the
interior castles this is a person who's just entered in life of grace maybe they've been
away for a while and they've gone to confession thanks be to God and they're there in a life
of grace so now they are in the first mansion yeah that's that's there this is not a question
of degree of outside and inside this is this is a different species okay because you've
got you've got this soul that's in sin and the soul that's in grace right in kawatsio
vitae eterni tatis right so this is the beginning of eternal life heaven has already begun for
this person but it's not a sure thing they're beginners and that's what that's what teresa
calls these people in this first mansion beginners and they are in a precarious situation she
says as far as i can understand the door of entry into this castle is prayer and meditation
i did not say mental prayer rather than vocal for if it is prayer at all it must be accompanied
by meditation in other words when you're praying blessing your food when you're praying just
saying rosary we've got to involve our mind and our heart or it's not even prayer i remember
john vienna you know he had a kind of a privileged vision of souls right and there was a seminarian
who was learning how to you know they how they had signed a seminary into a parish to
get a little experience and he had the seminary and praying the bravery with him and the guy
was just saying the words and he says you know you're you might as well not even be
praying because that's not prayer you're just saying the words whether john vienna understood
the latin or not is another question but his heart certainly was in it okay so that's what
she's saying now what you're going to find is these constants for the seven mansions
is that there are two poles so to say that are going to determine the symptomology of
where you're at well how did how how do i know well i'm going to look at these two poles
prayer the nature of my prayer and the whole life of vice and virtue and those are going
to be the symptoms what vices do i have whether it's mortal sin venial sin or imperfections
what virtues degree of virtue and what is my prayer like teresa vavila posits nine
degrees of prayer everybody knows what the first one is that's vocal prayer right vocal
prayer we all know what that is that's what we love you know god bless mommy god bless
daddy we all learned that when we were kids right and we don't graduate from that we should
still pray god bless you know everybody else this is something we don't graduate from at
the same time even though we don't leave that behind us we do we should grow and there should
be mental prayer
teresa's little you know she's she calls them paralyzed souls because they're like ossified
because they don't have habits of virtue they don't have habits of cooperation with grace
they don't have a profound prayer life she she compares them to the to the lame man next
to the pool for 30 years but unless our lord really you know gives them a grace they're
not going to move far or fast and because they're not making progress it's very easy
for them to fall out of grace into sin and then they're on the outside of the mansion
now she says these are very much absorbed by worldly affairs but their desires are good
sometimes though infrequently they commend themselves to our lord and they think about
the state of their souls so they're not very carefully for full of a thousand preoccupations
as they are they only pray a few times a month these are people who you know when she says
pray she's talking about mental prayer right with regard to these first mansions i can
give some very useful information out of my own experience i must tell you for example
to think of them as comprising not just of a few rooms but of a very large number there
are many ways in which souls enter into them always with good intentions so in the first
mansion there are many degrees within this many degrees that's what she's talking about
there's so many because there's going to be a degree you know a degree of of charity in
one soul that is not equal to the degree of other and therefore the ability to live a
certain virtue the ability to live a certain prayer that's not going to be the same but
a very large there are many ways in which souls enter them always with good intentions
but as the devil's intentions are always very bad he has many legions of evil spirits in
each room to prevent souls from passing from one to another and as we poor souls fail to
realize this we are tricked by all kinds of deceptions you must note that the light which
comes from the palace occupied by the king hardly reaches these first mansions at all
for although they are not dark and black is when the soul is in a state of sin they are
to some extent darkened so that they cannot be seen i mean by anyone who is in them and
this is in other words she's saying this darkness blinds us to the action of the devil now john
of the cross is a really fascinating thing he says no one how does he say it he says
anyone who does not practice mortification and penance will never understand how the
devil works think about that connection that's a necessary connection why because we've got
a fallen nature if i'm not denying myself good things if i'm not putting myself through
self-imposed trials to test my will to purify my affections to purify my attachments the
devil's gonna have a really easy time using those things against me but once i take stock
all right once i take stock of where my heart likes to be kind of adulterous when i say
adulterous i'm not talking about evil things i'm talking about just giving too much importance
to my hobby that's any one of us right where in other words what i do what i do for entertainment
what i do for relaxation which is a probably you know in all of our cases a good thing
and legitimate is it is it a way of offering something myself to our lord do i offer him
that and do i thank him for it or do i just see it as legitimate relaxation euchapelia
right legitimate relaxation or is it a means so when i moderate things good things i start
to realize how they had a pull on me i start to realize that the devil was actually using
this thing to distract me from from more important things from our lord and it's not because
she goes on and this is not because of anything that is wrong with the room but rather i hardly
know how to explain myself she always throws in these like uncertainties why because she's
a woman writing at the time that she's writing and you know she didn't want the the little
what nobody expects right the spanish inquisition breathing down her neck because she's making
some very strong affirmations right and so that wasn't really the place of a woman at
that time so she that's why she always throws these things she knows exactly what she's
saying but she kind of throws in like she tries to sound ditzy you know she's not she's
not but she wants to sound that way just to say you know i hardly know how to explain
myself and then she goes on with complete precision to explain herself because there
are so many bad things snakes and vipers poisonous creatures which have come in with the soul
that prevented from seeing the light it is as if one were to enter a place flooded by
sunlight with his eyes so full of dust that he could hardly open them the room itself
is light enough but he cannot enjoy the light because he's he is prevented from doing so
by these wild beasts and animals which force him to close his eyes to everything but himself
this seems to me to be the condition of the soul which though not in a bad state is so
completely absorbed in things of the world and so deeply immersed as i've said in possessions
or honors or business that although as a matter of fact it would like to gaze at the castle
and enjoy its beauty it is prevented from doing so it seems quite unable to free itself
from all these impediments everyone however who wishes to enter the second mansion will
be well advised as far as the state of life permits to try to put aside all unnecessary
affairs and business for those who hope to reach the principal mansion this is so important
that unless they begin in this way i do not believe they will ever be able to get there
for indeed even though it has entered the castle the soul is not free from great peril
in the mansion which it actually inhabits for being among such poisonous things that
cannot at some time or another escape being bitten by them in spite of a radical change
of habits and alteration of external behavior all is not well in the interior because of
the lack of abnegation the lack of mortification mental prayer is infrequent or at least not
regular we're not able to be perfectly faithful so the there's a dominance of natural virtue
over supernatural virtue so i mean there's there is a lot of virtue in these people but
it's mostly natural so these people in this in this mansion the
symptoms infrequent mental prayer in other words it's periodic it's not daily and there
is with regard to venial sin they're not real forget about imperfections venial sin imperfections
aren't even on the radar venial sins are pretty regular and there is the possibility of falling
in the mortal sin and coming back right away but there is that possibility that's that's
really kind of this in a few words the symptomology of this first mansion in the purgative way
those are called beginners now still in the purgative way there's another mansion and
the second mansion these are called good souls right these are good souls these people she
says do everything possible to avoid grave sin and they even have a certain ease with
which they do that and they recognize their own you know their stability and grace and
they they rejoice in it and they they have they realize they're they're really freed up in a big way
they can run from occasions of sin without being too attracted to them habitually in
a life of grace and they can have struggles and have to fight sometimes you know in other
words the virtue isn't the heart isn't purified completely and the virtue isn't refined as it
ought to be it isn't as perfect that as it ought to be that's why there are struggles back to that
quotation from John Paul the second and right up the splendor right he's talking about the
difference between you know the person who feels the weight of the law and those who are feel
freed by the law all right thanks to God's grace there isn't a complete surrender to Christ in this
second mansion so how are they going to progress they have to these are people who recognize that
to a certain extent and as a result make a commitment to constancy in mental prayer now
their mental prayer is going because there's constancy their mental prayer is going to develop
in the first mansion mental prayer is discursive what does that mean I go from thought to thought
and there is a primacy of the intellect in that mental prayer you know think of the the the
traditional method of Lexio Divina right I read the gospel of the day what does it say I meditate
second step what does it say to me I'm thinking about what word or phrase and the gospel of the
day jumped out at me and spoke to my heart now I'm gonna mull over that and I'm thinking about it
what does that mean for my spiritual life what does that mean for my my friendship in Christ
with my ongoing conversion etc etc etc then we go to the third prayer or at seal what does it make
me say now I'm gonna enter into dialogue with Christ okay now and now he conversed with my
friend as a friend to a friend and it's beautiful and this is the way we start okay that's that's
mental prayer in the in the first mansion and the fourth stage then of the fourth step in Lexio
Divina then is contemplation I don't really read anything I don't say anything I love and I'm loved
okay that's something that you know it's a little more affective with an a little more affective
doesn't always happen that's okay but because that's in constant there isn't growth when there's
constancy that Lexio Divina or that mental prayer is going to develop why because the intellect
through all of that exercise is starting to be purified and so all of these stupid things I've
seen and heard all right all of a sudden I don't really have a hold on my mind anymore because the
intellect is being purified there's also something very important for all of us all of us started
with me what do we do with thoughts and memories that happen during prayer stupid thoughts self
accusatory thoughts memories of socially awkward things I did that it kind of afflict to me I get
a lot of those okay what are we what do you do with those things well make them prayer we don't
repress these things we acknowledge them we offer them to our Lord and make it make of it a prayer
so don't don't get flustered don't think that no sometimes what are what's happening in our mental
prayer especially when when we if we haven't been constant with it faces or remember memories of
injustices come to us okay fine what is it what is what what's happening our Lord is revealing to
us memories and wounds that need to be healed and he wants to heal them and he certainly can
in his homily on the intellectual sufferings of our Lord Saint John Henry Newman tells us
that our Lord didn't drink the drugged wine on the cross because he wanted to have absolute
clarity of mind and thereby be able to redeem our memories to redeem our memories so heal them he
wants to heal their memories and the memory is the devil's playground because the devil can't
read your mind he doesn't know what you're thinking but he can give you thoughts and he
loves to use thoughts of those things that that are in your memory banks things that you don't
even recall perhaps in the moment but he can read us and he can cobble them together you can
represent them to you do you remember when somebody or go into adoration remember when
this guy said this to you or that nasty look you got and these stupid things come to us from like
yeah I remember that and then we go oh yeah but I'm in adoration and I shouldn't be thinking about
that and we kind of get flustered and so what Lord whoever that was I forgive him I ask you
to forgive him I ask you to forgive me for whatever rancor I've had in my heart I'm acknowledging
this I'm recognizing that you're bringing this to my attention so that you can heal my memory
you were there when this thing happened maybe it was a huge trauma you were there when it happened
and my little things matter to you I know that everything in my life matters to you and this not
least of all so I submit it to your precious blood I ask you to heal it I knew you were there
and you that you were there with me when I think of it I often don't think of it in context of you
but now you're teaching me to and so I let you heal that memory because you were there and you're
also there in my memory and you're here with me now in my prayer and so I give this to you to be
cleansed through the merits of her precious blood thank you Lord I praise you and then just go on
with your prayer so we don't interrupt it we don't get flustered we don't say well good is this
because how am I ever gonna get to heaven if every time I go into church or adoration I have
these stupid thoughts a lot of people say that to me that's real common well those thoughts are not
necessarily from the devil often they're from our Lord showing us this is what I want you to work
on this is something I want you to submit to me so when we do that and we're not flustered and we
continue to pray all of a sudden it's like our prayers freed up a bit or much very much and as
the intellect and the memory are purified now remember John of the Cross tells us that it's
it's faith the virtue of faith that purifies the intellect it's the virtue of hope that purifies
the memory and it's charity that purifies the will so as our intellect is purified through these
acts of faith through these through our mental prayer and it's always going to be the intellect
that's first addressed as the intellect is purified what happens after a certain after
a sufficient not complete but after a sufficient amount of purification our Lord starts to work on
our will and that's when our mental prayer becomes a lot less mental and a lot more affective with an
effective prayer what's happening he doesn't want me to think about a lot of stuff he doesn't want
me to read a lot of stuff there is there's like a pole a magnetic pole of one's heart to his heart
and this is what happens maybe at the end or of the first mansion and then in the beginning and
throughout most of the second mansion our prayer becomes more effective effective so it's no longer
mental prayer meant the first kind of a generic term for everything that isn't right vocal prayer
I always talk about mental prayer because most people don't know what it don't know about anything
besides vocal right so that's that's the starting point so the second degree of prayer is what's
going to open up the vistas right for all the other subsequent degrees of prayer there are nine
of them so in this second mansion Teresa says this chapter has to do with those who have already
begun to practice prayer to realize the importance of not remaining in the first mansions but too
often are not yet resolute enough to leave those mansions and will not avoid occasions of sin which
is a very perilous condition but it is a very great mercy that they should contrive to escape
from the snakes and other poisonous creatures if only for short periods and should realize that it
is good to flee from them in some ways these souls have a much harder time those in the second
mansion than those in the first mansions but they are in less peril so it's tougher but sure
for they seem now to understand their position and there is a great hope that they will proceed
further into the castle still I say that they have a harder time because the souls in the first
mansions are as it were not only dumb but can hear nothing and so it is not such a trial to
them to be unable to speak the others who can hear and not speak would find the trial much harder to
bear but that is no reason for envying those who do not hear for after all it is a great thing to
be able to understand what is said to one the souls then can understand the Lord when he calls
them for as they gradually get nearer to the place where his majesty dwells he becomes a very good
neighbor to them and such are his mercy and goodness and even when we are engaged in our
worldly pastimes and businesses and pleasures and hagglings when we are falling into sins and rising
from them again because these creatures are at once so venomous and so active and it is so
dangerous for us to be among them that it will be a miracle if we escape stumbling over them and
falling in spite of all that the Lord of ours this Lord of ours is so anxious that we should
desire him and strive after his companionship that he calls us ceaselessly time after time to
approach him and his voice and this voice of his is so sweet that the poor soul is consumed with
grief and being unable to do his bidding and thus as I say it suffers more than if they could not
hear him so they suffer because they hear his voice they suffer because he speaks to the
conscience and they know that they're not following them perfectly and but because of that
grief because of that sorrow of not following them perfectly they're sure because there's
there's there's a there's a longing there's a striving there's a fight there's a better and a
more efficient fight so they're capable of many illuminations and divine inspirations right of
promptings of the Holy Spirit and they're they're more awake to them the others were totally
oblivious to those promptings unless it was you know like one of those Looney Tune Looney Tune
anvils falling on the head then you know that's that's that that gets their attention but the
little things not so much so let's sum up what we've seen so far if the first mansion is the
place of those who run from worldly noise and enter into themselves in order to meditate love
God and implore divine grace then the second is inhabited by those who with all their strength
struggle to avoid what is truly dangerous grave sin and its occasions they renounce unnecessary
hobbies they adopt a life of greater recollection they have fixed times for mental prayer and from
time to time experience lights from the Holy Spirit inspirations interior movements of the
Holy Spirit disposing them to carry out the contents of those inspirations moving them to
be alone with him in an ever greater solitude where he speaks to their hearts with regard
you know these are people who with regard to their interior life so have obviously that their
life of prayer is now alive right and amongst these people those who can daily mass is certainly
a part of their life is this the Rosary if their schedule you know if they can do their duties as
you know worker and parent then they can they would they would love to and if they can do go
up to daily mass and the communions are our beautiful encounters with our Lord Teresa says
although the dwellers in this mansion are for the most part preoccupied with natural cares
they occupy their minds more with the things of our Lord much more so than those in the first
mansion they are people who are able to profit much more from a book or a homily or something
you know some spiritual reading than a person in the in the first why because there's a there's
an openness there with return with regards to their external conduct they seek to live out
mortification but it's in it's it's in constant the penances are in constant they're not they
don't persevere grave sin is rare if they do fall they have a very very deep repentance and come
back quickly remember in the first mansion there wasn't really any horror of venial sin and it's
actually a deliberate and frequent and here you know they're starting to wake up to to that
reality of what an offense that is to our Lord problem is once once you get to the second
mansion people think they're doing pretty good because there's no more sin the grave sins no
longer part of the deal and so they feel they can they can fall into certain complacency they can
feel a little too sure of themselves and sometimes because of that our Lord will allow them to fall
into grave sin just to wake them up to what their state is challenges well pride because now I'm
converted and I'm you know I'm on the right path so there can be pride in their assessment of
themselves there's also a temptation to what John of the Cross will look at this more next time but
John of the Cross calls spiritual adultery longing for seeking spiritual consolation in prayer
because it's a feeling it's a feeling John of the Cross is it it's I mean if you read it he's got
four big dense books really dense and they just say the same thing over and over it is just in
he's saying it from different angles he's saying it for people at different stages he's saying it
over and over with different words it's always the same thing our intellect our senses our willed
senses and our imagination those are going to be the obstacles the stumbling blocks and the things
that need to be purified in order to have union with our Lord that's all that's all he ever says
that's all he ever says that nada nada nada is nothing for the intellect for our willed
senses and for our imagination nothing uncreated okay so there so what you're gonna find is some
people depending on you know people have a tendency towards pride others towards vanity
others towards sensuality sometimes those who have a tendency towards sensuality you find this a lot
more in women but happens in men in their prayer that they're there because they're they're
entering into affective prayer which is wonderful they're flooded with all sorts of constellations
and it's beautiful it's not God okay God is not a feeling but it feels so good well that's okay
you know be grateful but it's a means it's not an end and our Lord allows that precisely because
we're weak he's you know when I want to take my dog out and he doesn't want to go out because it's
sub-zero you know I take treats and I throw him out I throw him out into the backyard and he goes
outside okay so you know our Lord does that too in our spiritual life he kind of dangles treats
in front of us and like oh that was nice I think I'll do that again then all of a sudden it's not
nice and we're out in the cold then my you know and I'm dry that's a good place to be that's a
good place to be because then I'm not living according to my senses so those are two now in
the purgative stage also fine we'll probably have time next time I think to look a little more
closely at this there are some people who have had a conversion they go into adoration they go
into mass they go on to make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament and I've seen thoughts come
real common very common I've seen our blasphemous thoughts even words real common I hear all the
time in people I hear it all the time from people and you know I'm horrible father now get in line
you're just like everybody else don't worry it's just way it is somebody doesn't want you doing
that so he's trying to throw these obstacles don't give him the satisfaction of reacting
what do we do with the memories right so we give it to our Lord Lord that word wasn't from me but
this unpleasant experience I give to you and I'm gonna live with you so so it not be something that
to separate me from you or even make me interrupt my prayer I'm gonna turn this into a prayer Lord I
praise your holy name for all of the blasphemous things that just entered my mind I praise your
holy name you can just say a couple of the divine praises quickly and just get on with our mental
prayer so that was just a little that was kind of an intro to the purgative way we're gonna look with
a little more precision how this next time with our got with Jonathan Cross is our guide we're
gonna look with a little more precision of what this purification of the intellect and the memory
means okay and of course the purification of the will in this stage and there's gonna be
purifications of these things later but what does it look like in the purgative way it doesn't look
like purification in the illuminative in the unit if it's very different so we're gonna look at what
is proper to the purification of the three faculties that John of the cross identifies
intellect memory and will next time you
