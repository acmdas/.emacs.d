In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, it is now, and it shall be, before the world without it. In the immaculate heart of Mary, great be to the Father, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.
So last time we looked at the purgative way in the writings of Teresa of Avila.
And so we went through the first mansion, the second mansion, and now we're going to do, it's not a repetition.
We're just going to approach that same state or stage through the lens of John of the Cross.
Now John of the Cross is a co-reformer with Saint Teresa of Avila.
He was a man who practically only knew sorrow growing up. A real tragic childhood.
His father married below his station and was rejected, and therefore the whole family, rejected by his father's patrician family.
And then the father died, leaving three boys and a widow, who went to knock on the respective doors of aunts and uncles, on the father's side obviously.
All of whom slammed the door in their face. So they were reduced to destitution, living on the street.
One of his brothers died of malnutrition. Juan, the last name was de Yepes Juan, and Francisco survived.
Juan went to get some money for his own education, working in a syphilitic clinic.
And so changing dressings, changing diapers, doing all sorts of works, all of the necessary chores in a situation like that, which was a real externalization of sorrow and suffering.
And he was already suffering in a certain sense in his interior, but this parish priest recognized a real gift in him and wanted to support his vocation.
He was sure he was going to be a Jesuit. And he studied in Salamanca, kind of like the incense belt of Spain.
Many orders had their seminaries there, houses of formation in Salamanca. I did a year in Salamanca.
It's funny, Salamanca is an interesting town, beautiful town.
You've got the old bridge and the new bridge that crossed the river Tormes. The only place in Spain that was greener than Ireland was that river.
There's a Roman bridge, one built by the Romans, and then there's a modern bridge, which was modern.
Heavy traffic has to go over the Roman bridge, like the heavy trucks. They have to go over the Roman bridge.
Anyway, it's a real town of culture and beautiful architecture, history, ecclesial history.
That's where he studied. He surprised everyone by joining the Carmelites, and he was attracted to the life of asceticism and prayer.
He was pretty discouraged soon after ordination when he found that things weren't as he had envisioned.
And he almost joined the Carthusians to satisfy that desire that he had for solitude, for prayer, for asceticism.
Carthusians are a semi-erometical order founded by Saint Bruno and God's providence sent St. Therese along his path.
And so he tells her first time he meets her that he's, well, you know, nice knowing you.
You're the famous reformer of the Carmelites, and I'm on my way out. I'm joining the Carthusians and she says,
no, that's not going to happen. God wants you to help me to reform the order.
So it's hard to say no to St. Therese. And so he stays.
Carmelite adopts the new habit, becomes a proponent of the reform.
Now the reform was a return to the primitive observance of the rule. Why are they called Carmelites?
Well, their spiritual home is Mount Carmel, right where Elijah was.
This is their spiritual home.
When the Muslims take over the Holy Land and kick the Carmelites out, the Carmelites are spread out through Western Europe,
but their spiritual home remains Mount Carmel.
And the reason I mention this, they're dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel,
but he's going to draw a map, a spiritual map of Mount Carmel that's going to be very important to understand his teaching,
kind of a road map. And it's kind of a primitive looking drawing, a sketch,
although his handwriting is much better than mine. Mine kind of peaked in second grade.
And at the top is the glory of God, union, and there is a straight path up,
which is sowed with the words nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
There is a detour to the left, which is inordinate attachment to heavenly things.
Then there is another detour on the right, inordinate attachment to earthly things.
Neither one of those leads to union, leads to the summit of Mount Carmel.
Christians who go by either left or right will remain in imperfection and in this life will never enjoy union.
He is kidnapped by anti-reform Carmelites.
And at night, kidnapped, put in a cell, he's in the cell for about nine months.
In this cell, he is not allowed to confess. He's not allowed to offer mass or receive communion.
He has a bravery. But when the sunlight comes through the small hole that serves as his window,
he has to position himself so he has the light to read his bravery, to praise bravery.
He was taken out of the cell, it's a tiny hole. He was taken out of that on Fridays and made to kneel in the refectory.
This was just the normal treatment for a rebellious religious.
This isn't like something extra now, rebellious religious published books and are lauded.
But this was the kind of the normal treatment for a rebellious religious.
And so then he was made to kneel in the refectory on Fridays and while they ate, he didn't.
And then there are certain humiliations that accompanied that.
Well, he manages to escape and his escape then allows him to further the cause of the reform.
And later he said that the worst of everything during those nine months in prison was that they didn't allow him to wear the habit of the reform,
that he had to put on the old, the other habit of the order of Carmel.
Because, you know, he's, he and Teresa are starting the order of Carmelades discalced, right, the discalced Carmelades.
Well, during that time, he wrote poetry in his mind.
And as soon as he got out, he put the pen to paper. And then he has two prominent poems.
He has a lot of, a lot of poetry, beautiful poetry. And then he's got romances.
He's got the romances are like commentaries on biblical history and doctrine.
But he has these mystical poems.
These two particular ones, The Dark Knight, and he's going to write two books that are commentaries on each stanza.
So The Ascent and The Dark Knight of the Soul.
Those are the two commentaries on the one poem, The Dark Knight.
They're about the spiritual itinerary.
And then he's got the,
The Living Flame of Love and the Spiritual Canticle.
Right, which comment on his poem, The Living Flame.
So,
One dark night fired with love's urgent longings. It sounds much better in Spanish, by the way.
One dark night fired with love's urgent longings. Ah, the sheer grace.
I went out unseen, my house being now all stilled.
In darkness and secure by the secret ladder disguised. Ah, the sheer grace.
In darkness and concealment, my house now being all stilled on that glad night in secret.
For no one saw me, nor did I look at anything with no other light or guide than the one that burned in my heart.
This guided me more surely than the light of the noon to where he was awaiting me.
Him I knew so well there in a place where no one appeared.
Oh, guiding light. Oh, guiding night. Oh, night more lovely than the dawn.
Oh, night that has united the lover with his beloved, transforming the beloved into his lover.
Upon my flowering breast, which I kept wholly for him alone, there he lay sleeping and I caressing him there in a breeze from the fanning cedars.
When the breeze blew from the turret as I parted his hair, it wounded my neck with its gentle hand, suspending all my senses.
I abandoned and forgot myself, laying my face on my beloved. All things ceased.
I went out from myself, leaving my cares forgotten among the lilies."
So, why a dark night? I thought this was all supposed to be happy.
Well, this is the way to happiness. You know, when you look at the inordinate attachment to heavenly goods on the left,
the inordinate attachment to earthly goods on the right, and then it says, you know, peace, justice, joy, all these things.
It says, none of these you will find there. And then at the top, at the peak of this mountain, he's got all of those beautiful things.
They're all there, awaiting at the top in this nothing, but the necessity is to follow these steps of nothing to the summit.
So, a couple of things about, a couple of terms, okay? Night. Why does he call it night? Night deprives us, he says,
the notion of night deprives us of that which is familiar and comfortable. Therefore, there's a certain deprivation.
There's a deprivation of the senses. And then, another reason it's called night and traveling at night is the road is invisible in the dark.
There are unseen obstacles along the way. True, but unseen. And we have to trust that this road, which itself is invisible,
because of the darkness, will lead us to our goal, which is also invisible. So, we're led more by faith than what we know.
So, he calls faith a dark night. I mean, we always talk about the light of faith, but there's also a darkness of faith, right?
Faith does not, Paul says, does not come from seeing, it comes from hearing. It comes from hearing.
And if we were to see the object of faith, well, that's no longer faith. That's why, you know, in heaven there is no faith anymore, no hope.
I was preaching to a convent of German nuns and I told them that above heaven was written,
abandoned faith and hope, all you who enter here. And they were a little taken aback. I was a little cruel.
I mean, obviously, if you see the object of your faith, well, that's no longer faith, right?
If you possess the object of your hope, there's no more hope, right? You got it. You're there. You're fine. Don't worry about it.
All you got is charity now. You're going to be okay for the rest of eternity, okay? So, no more faith and hope.
And anyway, I was just kind of toying with them and they did not appreciate it. I was not invited back.
He also calls it night. Again, as mentioned just now, because the goal itself is hidden. And our Lord hides in many ways.
God hides from us in the dark. You know, his spiritual daughter, Elizabeth of the Trinity, says she defines faith.
This is really, for me, very beautiful. She defines faith as a face-to-face meeting with someone, someone written with a large S,
a face-to-face meeting with someone in the dark. So he's no less present because you don't see him. You just don't see him.
So, this leaving the house all still then is the departure from our inner house, which has us imprisoned.
Imprisoned by what? By our desires and our attachments. John will rarely use the word sin. Interesting.
He'll talk about appetites. He'll talk about attachments. He'll talk about desires. But rarely, he's very incarnational.
For all the mortification and abnegation that he talks about, he's very incarnational.
But he's trying to foment order in our relationship with these creatures.
This path, the middle path of nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, all the way up to the summit, says John, is accompanied, he says, by several types of knights.
The first knight is a purgation. Well, these are his words. The first knight, or purgation, concerns the sensory part of man's nature.
The second stanza refers to the knight of the spiritual part of man's soul. The first knight is the lot of beginners. So let's go back and look at the words.
One dark night fired with love's urgent longings. Notice this is not a repression of love. It's not a repression of our affections.
It's an ordering of our affection in our heart towards our Lord. He is ultimately the spouse of our souls.
Ah, the sheer grace, I went out unseen, my house now being all stilled, in darkness and secure, by the secret ladder disguised.
Ah, the sheer grace, in darkness and concealment, my house being now all stilled.
So he's talking about what is the stillness? The stillness is that I'm free of this disordered attachment to things.
And this brings about a peace in the heart. When I have a disordered attachment to anything, there isn't peace and it's impossible to have peace.
Peace, as Saint Augustine defines it, right? Tranquillitas ordinis, right? The tranquility of order, that things are in the right place.
Being disguised, in darkness and secure, by the secret ladder disguised. He says that what disguises us, basically it's camouflage of faith, hope, and charity.
And the colors of each of those theological virtues make a habit, a religious habit.
Faith is green, hope is white, and charity is red.
In darkness and concealment, my house now being all stilled. So let's get back to his assessment of this first night.
The first night or progression concerns the sensory part of man's nature.
The second stanza refers to the night of the spiritual part of man's soul. The first night is the lot of beginners.
The second night or purification takes place in those who are already proficient at the time God desires to lead them into the state of divine union.
So this is from the introduction to the ascent of Mount Carmel.
I think I mentioned to you that I brought a friend to a bookstore when I was in college.
I was trying to get him some good Catholic books because something was working in his soul and he wanted to come back to the practice of the faith.
And so I thought I'd bring him to a used bookstore, get some old classics or something like that.
And I found for 25 cents the ascent of Mount Carmel, which was the best quarter I've ever spent in my life.
Although this first night and the night of beginners now we're in the purgative way.
Right. And what we're going to be seeing today really corresponds to the first mansion of St. Teresa.
And John says that even though this is a night in which the senses are impacted, it's still a night in which the spirit participates.
Obviously, because we're not a duality. We're not some Cartesian duality.
On the summit of Mount Carmel, after having taken the path of nothing, nothing, nothing, even on the mountain peak, he has the word nothing written.
So it's like some Russian Tao. What? I just finally get to the inside and it's empty. Well, it's not just nothing.
He also has the words of Jeremiah written there. He says, I brought you into the land of Carmel to eat of its fruits and good things.
And John says, only the honor and glory of God dwells on this mount.
And then around the top, he's got these words written, peace, joy, happiness, justice, wisdom, strength, love.
He says here, there is no longer any law because for the just man, there is no law.
He is a law unto himself, quoting St. Paul. What does that mean?
Well, when our will has been so configured with the will of God, the law of God is no longer something that is external to us.
It's something that is the source of our joy. It's not something that we're trying to achieve.
It's something, you know, it's like the old Palmolive commercial, you know, you're soaking in it.
So it's something that is shot through us. This law of God, the will of God then is what is the source of all of these other things.
Peace, joy, happiness, justice, wisdom, strength, love. And if I am not conformed with his will, then those things are going to, his law is going to seem onerous to me.
But for somebody who's gone through the entire ascent of Mount Carmel, it's a source of tremendous joy.
And not only at the top.
He says that the more we seek earthly goods, the less we have of them.
He says the same thing about heavenly goods. Heavenly goods are obviously creatures.
Consolations, my image of God, those are all creatures.
Those are all things that are not God. And he says, so in other words, to be, to be disordered, inordinately attached to these things that are not him are ultimately imperfections.
He's not talking about sins. He's talking about imperfections.
And, you know, this is not a path for just heroic ascetics, right? Men and women who have a habitual attitude of penance, of repentance, of prayer, of conversion.
They're invited along this path. But, you know, as we say in America, right, the man who defends himself, right, a lawyer, if a lawyer defends himself in the courtroom, he's got a fool, right, for a client.
Well, John is also assuming that people who are going to follow this journey then will be well accompanied, well accompanied.
This means spiritual direction and confession.
So the active night of the senses.
So this is going to begin with detachment. He's taking for granted that his readers are in a state of grace and want to be saints.
So detachment is lightening the load in order to ascend the mountain.
He says the following, it is regrettable then to behold some souls laden as with rich vessels of wealth, deeds, spiritual exercises, virtues, and favors from God, never advancing because they lack the courage to make a complete break with some little satisfaction, attachment, or affection.
They walk into the same thing, and thereby never reaching the port of perfection, which requires no more than a sudden flap of one's wings to tear the thread of attachment.
It's a matter for deep sorrow that when God has bestowed on them the power to break other stronger cords of attachment to sin and vanities, they fail to attain so much good because they do not become detached from some childish thing, which God has requested them to conquer out of love for him, and which amounts to no more than a thread or a hair.
So he's saying, you know, you can have a little bird that is chained down with a big, you know, one of those battleship chains, right, or with a thread.
Doesn't matter. The bird's not going to fly if it's weighed down by sin or if it's weighed down by an attachment to some creature.
So is he saying that we shouldn't use anything or have anything or like anything?
I mean, you know, take an espresso, for example, right? We all know the virtues of coffee, right? I think we can all agree on that, right?
And the vice of not having it, right? What happens to us when we don't have it, right?
I mean, there's a way to make it. There's a way to make it, right?
That's good. OK. Pasta al dente.
Germans don't know how to make pasta. Germans don't know how to cook a steak. They just don't know. I lived over there.
Believe me, they don't know pasta or steak. They just don't know how to do it right here.
If somebody serves you over in Germany and, you know, we know how it ought to be done, but it's not done right.
OK. Offer it up. Offer it up. Doesn't mean that we don't do things right.
But where's my heart? Is this a cause of a faith crisis for me?
I understand that when you don't have coffee, right? I mean, the theological virtues are kind of impacted somehow.
And then there comes the headache and the joints hurt and everything else. But my point is my heart, right?
Do I am I attached to having things my way?
And just do I think that my happiness, even passing happiness, is dependent on such things?
John's words. We are not discussing a mere lack of things. This lack will not divest the soul if it craves for all these objects.
We are dealing with the denudation of the soul's appetites and gratifications. This is what leads it to be free and empty of all things, even though it possesses them.
So he's saying you can use these things and even possess these things, but they don't have dominion over you.
So what is their role? Their means. Coffee in the morning keeps us from having a headache.
OK, so it's a means. John then gives us some examples of attachments that impede progress.
So there can be an attachment to a person. In other words, what is love?
Saint Thomas Aquinas tells us that love is in its best natural expression is desiring the good of the other.
So if I'm clingy to somebody because I want, I want, I want. Well, that's that's the disordered attachment.
If I'm clingy to somebody. I have an attachment to an article of clothing.
He says a book, a room, a way food is prepared, little satisfactions in tasting and knowing things, hearing things. Talk about curiosity and the desire to have news.
He says there may be greater attachments which involve one or other of the seven capital sins, which will separate us from God in a way that the little imperfections will not.
John says that these little attachments may seem to serve our purposes, especially in moments of trial, like comfort food or whatever. He says, but the effect is sour.
He says unsatisfied cravings that we feel weary, torment, darken, defile and weaken the soul. He says all of this in chapter in book one, chapters six through 10 of the ascent. And then he goes over the the effects of attachments to all of those things.
He says we grow weary in battling to have things our way rather than a type of indifference.
Fear and suspicion torment us because we fear the loss of those things that we're attached to.
And he says our minds are dark and defiled so that we can no longer see things objectively nor distinguish good from evil properly, thus blinding ourselves.
And then in our state, as children of God, he says we're weakened with regard to natural appetites.
He says the natural ones are little or no hindrance at all to the attainment of union, provided they do not receive one's consent nor pass beyond the first movements in which the rational will plays no role.
For to eradicate the natural appetites is impossible in this life.
So I mean these natural appetites, right? We have to eat, we have to drink, we have to sleep. Okay, we have to do these things, but all of that in order, all of that with order in moderation.
Then he talks about natural semi voluntary and obsessive desires with regard to food.
God has given us sight and smell and taste buds that enable us to enjoy meals.
And therefore there's a way to
have a meal
respecting the natural appetite
and not falling into a disorder.
And this is going to require self dominion in moderation, not just in the exercise, but above all in the will, the will.
This certain indifference to how things are prepared. I'm not finicky. I'm not demanding.
Certainly not too much in terms of quantity.
Also the right times. These are all things that Gregory the Great talked about when he was going over the four ways that we commit gluttony.
Too much and too much food.
Wrong times because I don't I don't have discipline. I'm too finicky about how it's prepared or I spend too much money on it.
John says there can be sudden urges for food and drink that can occur to us even in prayer and work.
He says these are semi voluntary because there we're not just respected.
We're not called to do something according to order.
But there is a certain disorder in the desire and therefore it has to be curbed.
It has to be resisted. It's not the proper time.
So you recognize he happens and so I offer it up to our Lord.
He says sometimes unsatisfied that can lead to a certain irritation and depression.
Which he said is not a problem for the soul. It's just a natural effect.
However, he says, an obsessive attachment to food and drink is a real danger.
And it's symptomatic of something deeper.
So he says even though we may not know exactly what that something deeper is, we just start working on it in its symptoms.
It's funny.
One thing I like to do just to bother them.
I work a lot with mental health professionals and not to make me feel better, by the way, just because of the nature of my work.
And I do feel better though.
And I always ask them as if I'm kind of, you know, just kind of hapless not knowing what I'm talking about.
So how do you define mental health?
It's funny because they start the usually they'll just say, oh, you know, there's really no answer to that.
Or they'll start talking about symptoms and other symptoms.
Those are symptoms. So, you know, it's not like when somebody is not wielding an axe trying to kill people.
OK, that's that's not mental health when they're not doing that. So that's a symptom.
OK, let's let's let's tell me what the definition is.
Well, there is no definition for it, really.
So that's fun.
Let's reveal the real deal to them, darkness.
So a certain darkness of their own profession.
We have our own darkness of faith, right, by which we travel and trust.
And John says that this, even though we don't know the root of some of these obsessions, if we're attacking the symptoms in the darkness of faith, we will find freedom.
Freedom.
And be able in this freedom then is going to allow us to give ourselves more holy to our Lord.
I mean, we all know what it is to.
To deal with somebody that's obsessive, obsessing about something, it's very hard to communicate with that person.
Because they're so fixated on something, something so that the notion of a communion right with that person is going to be a little illusory.
Think of how much more difficult then for our Lord, right, who wants to be all.
So we need self-knowledge.
And unaided, delving into the morass of our hearts and minds is sometimes not always rewarded with clarity.
And that's why He says we have to be well accompanied.
Beginning the ascent. For a better understanding of this beginner's stage, it should be known that the practice of the beginners is to meditate.
With discursive reflection, using the imagination.
A person in this stage should be given matter for meditation and discursive reflection.
And he should make himself...
And in doing so, learn to enjoy spiritual things and discover even a delight and satisfaction in spiritual things at the cost of the senses.
Now this is not what he's going to say later on in the spiritual life.
This is going to be something you have to overcome, but this is how it starts.
So in other words, when we start the path of meditation, of mental prayer, or leksiu divina, what's happening?
We're imagining our Lord on the cross, we're imagining our Lord in the Garden of Gethsemane, we're imagining the enunciation, whatever.
There's a certain purification of the intellect that's taking place. And our affections are fed.
God gave us a heart to love and be loved.
We're allowing these ideas that come prayerfully through our reading of scripture to enter our mind.
And in doing so, purify our mind of unworthy thoughts, displacing them through holy thoughts.
And like a percolator, kind of dripping down into the heart and inflaming our heart with holy affections for our Lord or our Lady.
So this is the way of prayer for the beginner.
And he says that this delight in spiritual things, which he's going to make us disavow later,
but right now he says this delight in spiritual things works to displace our disordered attachments.
So we have ordered attachments towards our Lord, our Lady, and the things of God.
So that's in the stanza three of the Living Flame of Love.
Being fed with the relish of spiritual things, the appetite is torn away from sensual things
and weakened in regard to the things of this world.
And he knows that this is hard work.
If you're not doing mental prayer every day, you're cheating yourself out of spiritual progress.
There just simply will not be spiritual progress if this is not a habit.
And you know, for anyone that comes to me for spiritual direction, that is a requirement.
There has to be a daily commitment to mental prayer.
About this, John says, many acts in no matter what area will engender a habit.
Similarly, the repetition of many particular acts of this loving knowledge becomes so continuous
that it informs and forms the soul.
And with time, as we'll see in subsequent talks, this prayer will become more simple,
more direct, less moving parts. We'll talk about that later.
Now, this lightening the load requires meditation, obviously,
because if we're just denying ourselves things, that goes nowhere over a period of time.
We just end up giving up.
We're feeding our mind, we're feeding our heart with the love of God in prayer.
So prayer and abnegation, prayer and fasting, prayer and mortification, these have to go together.
To support each other, not one without the other.
And if you're feeling comfortable and warm and fuzzy, then remember these words of John of the Cross.
Endeavor to be inclined always, not to the easiest, but to the most difficult.
Not to the most delightful, but to the harshest.
Not to the most gratifying, but to the least pleasant.
Not to what means rest for you, but hard work.
Not to the consoling, but the unconsoling.
Not to the most, but to the least.
Not to be wanting something, but to be wanting nothing.
And this is not something that is just locked in 16th century Spain.
He's not just a child of his culture. He's talking about a universal need.
If Christ is to be all for us, then we have to order our relations with created things.
Have you ever heard of Dag Hammerskold?
He was the youngest secretary general of the UN.
Very interesting man. Fascinating character.
He loved our Lord tremendously.
He loved our Lord tremendously, and he's kind of trying to run the UN,
knowing that anything he did would only succeed if it was rooted in prayer and fasting.
Very few people know about this, and he took a vow of celibacy,
offering himself to our Lord for peace in the world.
And of course, few people at the UN understood this.
People in the world of diplomacy, people in the world of politics, that doesn't make sense.
And here he is, a man who understands that we have to give God something
if we're going to ask for something, and he gave him himself.
And he wrote this. He said,
So, it's easy to misunderstand John and think of him as somebody who is Jansenist,
speaking of him as a Puritan who is averse to the beauty of creation,
to somebody who is averse to human love,
or the use of the things that we use and have to use.
It's neither defect nor excess.
Virtue is in the mean, and it's not going to be the same for each person,
because we have different habits, we've got different weaknesses,
we've got a different history.
So, we're not pure spirits, and therefore we don't have to worry about denying our flesh.
Obviously we do, but with more moderation and constancy.
Those are the two principles that have to guide our fasting and our penance.
Moderation, which means it doesn't impede my carrying out of God's will.
Parent, worker, priest, student, whatever.
I have to be able to do his will, my work, because that's his will,
and his will doesn't pull us in opposite directions at the same time.
So, if my fasting is keeping me from working, then my fasting has to be recalibrated.
I've got to change something there.
Paul says in the Corinthians, all things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
So, whatever you do, do to the glory of God.
So, this is the rule of the day, doing it for the glory of God.
Where's my heart in this?
Having a meal with friends, right?
Is this something that is an end in itself,
or is there a certain spiritual communion there between these friends in Christ that is uplifting?
That's what John is talking about.
Not all things build up, even though they're permitted.
Christ has to be the center of it then.
Christ wants to be the all in this.
Exaggeration and overzealousness above all, as characteristics of a beginner, will end in failure
and abandonment of any discipline whatsoever.
If somebody at the start places abnegation and penance as the centerpiece,
that's also a distortion.
It has to be there.
But, you know, if we're looking at the receipt of this gift that we're giving to our Lord,
and we're just fixating on how much it's costing us,
we're not fixating on him.
That goes nowhere.
That's not very pleasing to him.
Here, I gave you this gift, and it really cost me a lot of money. Enjoy.
Well, thank you, I guess.
Are you going to write it off?
Whoever keeps my commandments is the one that loves me,
and he who loves me will be loved by my Father,
and I will love him and reveal myself to him.
So this is the key then, right?
So there's a Trinitarian center that then will demand this detachment.
When we live for the Trinity and the Trinity lives in us,
and we know ourselves as children in the Son,
loved by the Father, imbued by the Holy Spirit,
joined to the mystical body of Christ,
that starts to put things in perspective,
things that I use, my relationships with others.
In Romans 2, John says,
My son, I will give myself to him who loves you.
So this is the Father speaking to Christ. This is beautiful.
My son, I will give myself to him who loves you,
and I will love him with the same love I have for you,
because he has loved you whom I love so.
So for our meditation, what does he suggest?
He suggests, well, using the Gospels for our meditation.
He suggests using the Song of Songs. That's his favorite book.
He said we can also meditate on truths of the faith.
God seated on his throne in resplendent majesty,
considering the beauty of heavenly light.
He said all of these things are healthy.
We can consider God's presence,
God's presence through contingency and all created things,
not in a pantheist way, obviously, but that which sustains things.
God's presence in us through the state of grace,
making of us temples of the Holy Spirit.
This is also a third notion of God's presence that's good for us,
how our Lord inflames in us holy affections for him.
And doing this then, it's easier to say my house is all stilled,
because our hearts, our affections, our desires
have been reoriented, recalibrated, centered on our Lord
and taken off of these things that all of a sudden find their right place.
It's not that we are denied all of the things that we need and use,
but they find their right place.
Tranquillitas ordinis, the tranquility of order,
everything is in his right place.
Imagine our Lord who is so in love with us,
all of our concerns are important to him.
He doesn't despise them, he doesn't laugh at them,
he doesn't think they're little nothings,
even though they are in many cases.
Because they're kind of the mess of ourselves that we've made ourselves,
he's kind of made it important to him like a mother who pretends
to really be fascinated with the story that the child is telling,
with every detail in there.
There's a certain fascination there, even though the kid is making it all up.
That's my son's little story that he's telling me.
This is him, this is who he is, these are things that make up his life
and it's important to a parent.
So how much more so than for our Lord?
And we start to divest, to travel in this nudity
at the base of the mountain, we start to divest ourselves of these things,
it gets easier, and we pass through this active night of the senses,
which will be followed by another night,
which we'll talk about next time we talk about this stuff.
And that is the passive night of the senses.
And I would say that that really corresponds to this passive night of the senses,
then it corresponds to the second mansion.
So next time when we meet, we'll still be in the purgative way,
but we're going to look at how our Lord works on us,
works on the purification of our sensed being.
