** 06:04 44F mostly clear, forecast 58 sunny.
** 09:07 Weigh 187.4 starkers. Showered, not shaved yet. Running secondary backups (money, mail, home). Woke V a few minutes ago.
** 14:12 Drive to Church and back was easy - light traffic and light attendance today both at 0930 and 1100. Sang hymns only. 62F outside, so turned off the heat and opened the windows to get some fresh air. Copied the backups to WDBOOK and now to OFFSITE1.
** 21:18 OFFSITE1 is finished and packet to take to Mim's. OFFSIDE2 (aka Media_Backup) is loading. Delivered Nanaimo Bar to neighbors, took a walk, napped, spaghetti, then some video before doing EP. Earlier I added a dozen or so books from data/www to Calibre, added other files from that drive to already installed computer books (mobi, pdfs mostly). Deleted some from www that were already installed in Calibre.

** 15:54 A very nice lunch with Nancy and Barb, and Rick toward the end. They gave each of us a cook book for our birthdays, and made it home a little late for her PT appt, but they rescheduled to 1545.
** 20:52 RAC went reasonably well after I got connected. Zoom on minos didn't connect at all - had to make do with the Mac.

** 11:10 Bread is rising the second time. V is napping until noon. Just talked with Mim re V's trouble starting the car yesterday. It may have been a weak battery in her dongle, it may not. There's a new battery in it anyway (although the battery was bought in 2017). V went to Wegman's early - a big buy ($135). No bran flakes.
** 22:01 Made meatballs, potatoes and yellow pepper in the air fryer. Just had a bath. off to bed now.

** 11:39 Adriana texted around 0800, I called back and we had a long talk. She was just leaving Squamish in the rain, got snow when she reached Whistler. She just texted from Lilooet, so she made it over the Duffy OK. On her way to Burns Lake tonight, home tomorrow. Driving a Kia of some sort. Called Expedia about V's flight, nothing they can do, KLM says to address the wheelchair or other access issues at the airport or at early checkin (24 hours before flight). That's done, and also cancelled this Thursday's PT appt. Wesley may come 1/19 after my PT then.
** 15:35 Finished the ham soup and had some pizza. Did the dishes. Fell asleep reading. Ready to go for a walk now.
** 21:05 Had dinner at Mission BBQ, sat next to Maryrose. Had birthday cake for dessert, then watched a bit of TV and said EP.

** 16:44 Vision seems better. "God's Word" by Ratzinger arrived. All the outdoor ornaments are down and indoors - the tree and wreath are drying out in the kitchen. Won't put them away for a few days. V made chicken thighs w potatoes and etc. in the crock pot. Choir practice tonight.
** 21:27 Back from choir practice. Waiting for V to talk with Craig.

** 16:35 Added some more epubs to Calibre - created a "Literature" library. Added code to edit a file as root to emacs.

** 14:25 Maria's fine with me so far, wants another echo cardiogram (Wednesday at 1000) to see whether any changes are called for. Helped V pack Christmas decorations. 99% done now. Just need to get them into the crawl space. Vacuumed, checked old bag for earrings - didn't find any.

** 16:13 All the Christmas things are in the crawl space. Dragged cable to the front of the house only to find that there's no junction box there. Will have to research where the power to the car port is sourced. May just take power for V's heater from the hall outlet where it's currently plugged in. It's clearly not overloading the circuit now. Showered after. Joined Mastadon emacs server. Vestry tonight, will get Chinese in a bit. Probably will return all Calibre books to the main library after adding the named tag to all.

** 12:42 Added Charles 1, King and Martyr, to the diary, in Wikipedia noticed that he was High Church/Arminian, so in Arminianism noted Wesley, and then Oden. Found text of an Oden book on Spiritual Guidance that was based on his take on Pope Gregory the Great. It's in Calibre as epub now, not edited yet. Expecting to walk to LAMart now.
** 16:11 Was napping in the LR when Vivi dropped by. She left a few minutes ago.
** 19:29 Another RAC appeal was found against the RAC. Both recent ones were regarding shed locations on corner lots. Perhaps we need to revise the Guidelines for corner lots? Otherwise we're "wrong" to be finding based on the Guidelines. Listening to the OMCA Board meeting now.

** 08:42 Entering all of this manually because C-c C-j still takes me to the top of the file and I have to open the file manually with all the “normally hidden” org-mode (PROPERTIES:, CREATED: END:) showing for each daily entry. Something has gotten buggered and I don’t know what. Might be something completely unrelated to messing with denote - may have brought something into the mix when I updated package. Who knows? At any rate it’s something I want to get fixed. My next thought is to close all of the other emacs instances (mu4e, calendar, eshell) and restart them to see if they’re working as expected. If not, I might rename .emacs.d and pull down the complete last github listing. Wish me luck.
