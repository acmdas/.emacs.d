INTRODUCTION

TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY

"Behold, I bring you tidings of great joy that shall be to ail the
people" (Lk 2:10). These words addressed to the shepherds by the
angels remain forever engraved on our hearts since the Son of God
chose to be born of Mary in order to come doser to men and dwell
among us. At the dawn of salvation, the message prodaimed is the
good news of a birth, that of the Savior of the world. By associating
man with His work of giving life, by delegating to him the responsi-
bility of transmitting to other men the gift of human life, God invites
man to make a célébration of every birth, a célébration which among
ail générations, would mark the history of humanity.

The shepherds were hardly let down: they went in haste, full of
joy, to see the newbom. And St. Luke tells us how their eagerness
was rewarded. In effect, these poor shepherds were the first, after
Mary and Joseph, to perceive that the newbom, naked and power-
less, came to fuKill God's promises.

By making His entrance into the world in this way, Jésus there-
fore anchored salvation in the joyous newness inherent in every hu
man birth. But He also revealed that every human birth was the
bearer of new meaning.From the moment the Child is seen,He is of-
fered for the "shepherds"' appréciation; they approach to look upon
Him and marvel. But the Child is also the sign through which the
witnesses are led to acknowledge the image of God. Path of God to
men,the Child is also path of men to God.

Ever since Bethlehem, a solidarity between the children of men
and the Son of God is affirmed,for better or worse. For the better, be-
cause ail the children of men are called to become children of God
and brothers and sisters of Jésus. For the worse, because ail the chil
dren of men are exposed, as Jésus was, to being rejected and being
put to death.

In this regard, contrasted with that of the shepherds, Herod's re
action, reported by St. Matthew,is revealing(Mt 2). Unlike the shep
herds, Herod doesn't let himself be called by the Child. He thinks
that the Infant Jésus has corne to rob him of his power; he believes
his security is threatened. Thus if the Child makes Herod tremble,it
is simply because, by His fragile presence,the xmjust character of the
tyrant's power is unmasked: Herod rules only for himself. And de-
siring to get at Jésus, he exterminâtes ail the infants who reflect His
image. By attacking the iimocent infants, Herod himself demon-
strates the wickedness of the power he exercises.

Thus, in His infancy the Son of God shows that between the
smallest and Himself a solidarity is sealed which nothing through
the centuries will contradict. Henceforth, the quality of power will
be evaluated on the basis of the quality of attention given to the
weakest in human society.

In the 19th century, Léo XIII revitalized this quality of attention
on behalf of the most underprivileged. The Church celebrated in
1991 the centenary of his encydical Rerum Novarum, in which, we
know, he denoimced with such prophétie accents, the "rmdeserved
misery of the working class"(RN 2). If the prophétie words of Léo
Xni had been better heeded and put into practice, humanity woidd
be spared many of the evils that have pimctuated this century which
is coming to a dose.

It is important that the intention of this great encydical be reacti-
vated today. The challenge which was advanced over a himdred
years ago was the relief of workers' oppression and exploitation. By
way of fidelity to this héritage,it is urgent for Christians and all men
of good will, presently to take up the major challenge of our time,
namely releasing from oppression those in our society who are the
weakest and most vulnérable: first of all imbom babies (those given
the beautifui name nascituri, those about to be bom);then the incur-
ably sick, the handicapped,elderly persons;finally, the innumerable
hordes of poor and oppressed who are abused in so many ways as
their ignorance is taken advantage of.

In fact,for many years now we observe,an accelerated lesse^g
of respect owed to human life. This development alone justifies a
priority commitment on the part of all men of good will. What
makes this commitment not only justified but urgent are the cam-
paigns to gain total control over human life. These campaigns are
led, on the national and international level, by public as well as pri-
vate organizations. We are struck,in particular, by the number of in
ternational conférences aimed at the realization of this goal.

Just as the Church could not remain silent in the 19th century,so the Christian community cannot remain silent at the présent moment when some are attempting to organize the"New World Order" and when the profile of the 21st century is being defined. These actions against human life have assumed such a magnitude that numerous people, coming from a variety of spiritual, religious and philosophical backgrounds, have begun to become aware of them, to become anxious about them and even to react against them. They know that the respect owed to human life is rapidly deteriorating, openly and in diverse ways. These people and ail other men of good will long to be enlightened and directed. We see the evil in whose name some would refuse the Church the freedom to speak out in a domain so décisive for the future of humanity. To make use of this right is even an imperative duty.^ This duty is pressing due to the fact that respect for human life is first of ail a problem of natural morality; still more,obviously, Christian theology also has a spécifie contribution to make to this subject. But when, even among Christians, moral conscience is darkened to the point of no longer perceiving the most elementary demands of justice, it becomes an intégral part of the service which the church owes the human community to revivify in it the sensitivity of this moral conscience. The Church, which loves ail men, could not resign her-self to the idea of the mutilation or élimination of even one innocent human being.

The actual situation facing this notion is particularly serions in that, often without thinking, men of today, Christians included,flirt with idéologies of death. Before this hopeless perspective the Church must deflate ail the myths which are the source of it. More than ever the world needs to hear a word of hope. To ward off this obsession with death, to return to men the joy of living and loving,the Church must help men rediscover the fact that their life has meaning,that it is beautiful, since God loves us and calls us to love.
