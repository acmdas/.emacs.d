SOME AIDS AND ADVANTAGES
The good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished, but the good things which belong to adversity are to be admired.

HE RULE of the Church contains all that is necessary for sanctity, but this is reminiscent of Catechism language that speaks of a minimum "necessary for salvation"; what is not strictly necessary can still be extremely useful. Balanced Rule and direction save the Proficient from a good deal of dull learning, but this does not mean that reading, either of doctrine or devotion, is anything but a wise adjunct to the spiritual life if used sensibly and according to the interests and capacities of individual souls.
Theological reading is useful in that most modern Christians are healthily concerned with reason. However loyal and, in the right "holy" sense, obedient to parish priest or director they may be, it is obviously better to be informed than ignorant, presuming that knowledge is to be applied and used. And there is never any great virtue in blind obedience. Chris¬tian prayer, thence Christian life, depends on the great eternal facts, beginning with the truest attainable conception of God; and the exercise of grappling with these ultimate problems, however little progress we seem to make, subtly adds to the quality of our prayer. It guards us from the ever present danger of a one sided "this-worldliness" and keeps things in proportion in times of trouble. Many of us—especially parish priests—would worry far less about life's practical difficulties if we thought a little more about the meaning of the word "God", or of his Incarnation in Christ; of the Atonement and the glory of the Church. Theology brings us back to the solid comfort of fact when feelings and emotions get out of hand.
Devotional reading may inspire zeal and strengthen the will in periods of laxity; the lives—and especially the auto-biographies—of the Saints can inspire our dullest moods. But, without worrying with petty little rules, it is wise to keep a wary eye on balance and to put a slight curb on our natural inclinations. Too much theology tends to cold intellectualism, and too much devotion to sentimentality; it is a true maxim that the slightest coercion towards the opposite of our natural bent is a wise discipline. A little hard thinking is good for the devotionally inclined, and a little devotion comes not amiss in the life of the scholar. Many people who have "no brains for theology", or who claim no attraction for "that senti-mental stuff", could find an added interest in their lives if they would only make the occasional attempt.
As in Christian life itself, both aspects become focused in the harmony of the Mass, which, itself the greatest of all devotion, contains within itself all theology. The busy layman who contents himself with a working knowledge of the Mass will finally discover that "Eucharistic" theology overflows into all other branches.

"Fellowship" is an unfortunate word which in a parochial context takes on a rather weak and artificial flavour. Parish "fellowships", like Sunday school treats and mothers' meet-ings, rightly or wrongly suggest an anaemic mixture of socio-logy, gossip and rather duU "fun". But Christian fellowship is much more than this, the greek word koinonia means nothing less than an extension of the full-bodied relation of love in Christ that exists in direction. It is the unifying power of the Holy Ghost which, at Pentecost, turned a collection of individuals into the organic Body of Christ.
In this section I am only concerned with the expression of this spiritual bond in ordinary intercourse, which is a con-siderable aid to prayer and yet one which we seem strangely reluctant to cultivate. There is indeed a natural reticence to discuss spiritual things, but coupled with English diffidence this tends to make religion an unmentionable subject even amongst the faithful. Yet there seems no real reason why Christians should not meet together, in clubs, pubs, and private houses, as naturally and amicably as golfers or anglers. Much is gained by both the bond of common interest and the semi-technical conversation involved. In any walk of life it would be surprising to assess how much we have learned by "talking shop" with friends who share our interests; how many tips about gardening, cricket, or cookery we have almost subconsciously absorbed in casual talk. Yet prayer is a much more intrinsic and "ordinary" thing than any of these; why should it not be a normal topic? Furthermore such fellowship is the natural adjunct and support of direction, which helps us to use a director wisely. When the car goes wrong and refuses to start, we usually ask help from a motorist friend before sending for the professional mechanic, and we probably learn something valuable in the process. "Good morning, Charlie, have you made any good meditations lately? " or "Hullo, Mary, now could you just help me with a little bother with intercession" sounds a little curious, but I fail to see why it should.
In the cause of true evangelism, we must surely give the general impression to the world that we are doing something important and decisive. However tedious the cricket bore at Test Match time, he at least leaves the impression that his game is something containing much more than meets the in-experienced eye. On the rare occasions when religion is openly discussed at all, it so often degenerates into a dull quibble about morals or doctrine; it is not discussed as something that one does, with exciting implications, techniques and schools of thought. I do not see why a friendly argument in a pub, as to the respective merits of Ignatian and Salesian methods of prayer, should be any more out of place than a similar dis¬cussion about bowling leg-theory against orthodox off-spin. In our discussion on habitual thanksgiving, I urged that the shared Good Friday cod was only completed by a special little luncheon on Ascension Day—or on any other festival. Here I venture to add that it is this (possibly extended to friends and enquirers) rather than the "parish breakfast", that could constitute the real agape.

If only for completeness it is worth placing the liturgical seasons under the heading of aids to prayer, although their deeper implications have been discussed with regard to the Kalendar. The one point here is that, contrary to general opinion, special provisions for Lent and Advent do not normally come into the main structure of Rule, but these seasons constitute occasions for a right variation of it. This means that, although the basic Rule remains, it may be expanded or elaborated according to strictly personal needs. Without departing from custom and tradition, we may rightly use Lent, for example, as a time of definite battle with par-ticular problems and sins. My personal opinion therefore is that we should not worry too much about current fashions in fasting; sometimes whole parishes seem to make a kind of corporate Lenten fast of tobacco, or sugar or alcohol. This is impressive and has something to be said for it, but it is obviously going to be more or less rigorous and creative according to diverse personal habit. It seems that individuals would be better advised to make their own private fasts— preferably under direction—which attack particular failings and nurture personal qualities. Corporate spirit is nurtured and safeguarded by Rule itself, not by its variations and embellishments.
Needless to say all the seasons have their significance in this respect, and we must certainly not forget or minimize the festive seasons as well as the actual feasts; in Christian life Lent is completed not simply by Easter Day but by the fifty days of Eastertide. All the seasons, as we have seen, have their recollective significance; slackness in thanksgiving might be more easily overcome by a suitable Eastertide Rule rather than a Lenten one. And nothing is quite so deadening to creative progress as a monotonous sequence of " Sundays " and "weekdays".

Retreat
A "retreat" is a period of about three days spent at a "retreat house" or religious community, within the frame¬work of Office and Mass and in complete silence: a kind of intense spiritual sprint compared with the steady marathon through life. It can be made "privately", when the retreatant makes his own plan of prayer—usually with help from a spiritual director—or it can be a "conducted" retreat, made with a small group of people (normally between 12 and 20) and interspersed with addresses by a priest who is available for confession or direction if required.
There is ample literature dealing with the form, purpose and technique of retreat, much of it published by the Association for Promoting Retreats1 which is always glad to receive enquiries and advise. But there are four extra points of special relevance here.
(1) It must be insisted most strongly that, as an aid to spiritual life, retreat has a value in its own right, and any attempt to mutilate its structure, or use it for ulterior motives, is bound to end in failure. It is essentially a period set aside from worldly worries and given to God freely and fully, yet it so happens that troubles and problems often get solved in retreat if only we forget them. The basis of the whole thing is God-centredness, surrender and absolute silence; but there is one—and so far as I know only one—important exception to this rule:
(2) The origin and structure of retreat is generally held to be the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius Loyola; to what extent we should adhere strictly to this teaching, or what variations are permissible, are subjects of debate among experienced conductors with which we need not bother. But the Exercises themselves, despite their objective emphasis, contain one large section of a more personal nature. What St Ignatius calls the Election is a detailed scheme of meditation to be applied to the few really far reaching decisions of life;

vocation, marriage, or matters relating to important per-manent work. And I think it can be argued from the spirit and historical context of the Exercises that the decision to embrace Rule, or to seek regular direction, is sufficiently important and vocational to qualify. Provided a person has had reasonable experience in the ordinary ways of pastoral prayer—provided that is, that he is a reasonably "good Churchman"—retreat may be a good test, and a good start, to Regular proficiency. Furthermore:
(3) Rule is sure to seem a little artificial and onerous at the beginning; all new techniques are cumbersome until each considered detail fits into a single harmony. At first, learning to drive a car demands a seemingly impossible combination of movements by hands, feet, and eyes, which suddenly be-come synchronized into a single rhythm—we "get the feel" of it. Thus, while it is possible to learn to drive by a series of weekly lessons spread over several months; technique and control may be gained more quickly by two or three days continuous practice. After such intensive experiment a man may not be a very good driver, but he will have gained confi-dence which continuing experience will supplement. So retreat might be a good way of mastering that basic technique of living to Rule whereby it becomes an unobtrusive and natural part of ordinary life; it gives us an early desire, or "taste" for spiritual things. The considerable effort required by a three- day retreat may well taper off into a wisely constructed general Rule without burden or strain; habits of prayer can be acquired which might otherwise take months to form.
A further point is that the bond of true fellowship so often lacking in parish life is much more readily and spontaneously expressed in retreat. It is ironical that a dozen complete strangers so often gain a sense of deep spiritual inter-dependence in a three-day retreat which is lacking in congre-gations worshipping together week after week for years on end. Again the "feel" or "taste" of the thing is important, even to individuals, and retreatants, like penitents, may well exercise a deep and lasting influence on their own parishes. And, although rather wide of our context here, the significance of organized parish retreats is obvious enough.
(4) Sufferers from aridity, or spiritual dullness, are com-parable with sportsmen who are "stale" or "out of form", and there are two main ways of attacking this problem. A man may give up his game for a period, have a rest from it, in the hope that he will return with fresh zeal and energy; or he can go on and on until he plays himself out of his "bad patch". So with prayer, a little holiday from it is sometimes necessary, or difficulties may be overcome by plodding on, or even by a final concentrated effort. This choice is always a difficult one, in which external direction is strongly advisable, but if the latter alternative is chosen, retreat ably fulfils the need.

Although Rule is best restricted to the simple foundations of Christian living, it in no way opposes the use of lesser devotional customs; the Rosary, Stations of the Cross, and extra-liturgical devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, are all proper aids to prayer if used wisely, with discernment and in proportion. But if Rule allows, or even encourages these things, it nevertheless insists on balance; little progress will be gained by daily worship at Benediction and monthly partaking in the Mass! or by continual use of the Rosary to the neglect of the Office.
Finally, "Who can look on nature and not see God?" asks St Hilary; the whole creation is an aid to prayer, and in habitual recollection all things manifest the divine presence and glory. Today's serious Christian has a not unhealthy horror of Pantheism, sentimentality, and everything asso-ciated with "nature worship", yet however abused by sin and ignorance, truth remains truth. The proficient need not fear the help offered by nature and friendship, the much despised "quiet walk in the woods with God" can be a real spiritual experience; so long as all is balanced by Rule and harnessed to moral and ascetical theology. The creation is no less good for being so frequently abused; wine does not become poison because some men get drunk.
What has been said of the arts applies to all things widely sacramental; they are given us to be used and supernaturalized, and Rule continues to dispose of worry and gives us freedom. We may freely worship God in the flowers and the birds just in so far as we worship him in choir and at the Altar, which is the whole secret of an integrated and holy Christian life "in the world Perhaps the most topical teaching from St Thomas Aquinas is that, while lesser men sought—and still seek— immediate knowledge of God, he was content to begin with the reality, or Being, or ens, of ants, stones and bits of wood. By first seeking God in creation he saw all creation in God. And this is the essential first step that many of our well- meaning Christian sociologists, economists and politicians are apt to miss; the prior question in the whole problem of the Christian's relation with the world is concerned with the ascetical significance of, and his relation with, things. The Christian attitude towards money, for example, depends entirely upon the Christian attitude towards the things which money buys and sells; and that is a matter of ascetical theology. The Foundation of The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola contains a good deal more Christian sociology and politics than modern thought is wont to suppose.
