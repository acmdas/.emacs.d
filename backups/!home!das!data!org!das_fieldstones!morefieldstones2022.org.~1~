** The Modern Tyrant
Tuesday, 30 November, 2022

“The modern tyrant is evil because of his elusiveness. He is more nameless than his slave. He is not more of a bully than the tyrants of the past, but he is more of a coward.”—G.K. Chesterton, /All Things Considered/

** Election Day 2022
Tuesday, 08 November, 2022

“The society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools.”—Thucydides

** The Key to Science
Monday, 07 November, 2022

“[W]e compare the result of [a theory’s] computation to nature…[and] compare it directly with observations, to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science.”—Richard Feynman, /The Character of Physical Law/, 1965 

** The Spirit of Wrath
Friday, 14 October, 2022

“The spirit of wrath—not the words—is the sin; and the spirit of wrath is cursing. We begin to swear before we can talk.—Mark Twain

** Profaning Learning
Thursday, 13 October, 2022

“If learning were profaned by extending it to all kinds of people one would see far more men capable of raising doubts than of resolving them, and many would be better able to oppose truth than to defend it.”—Cardinal Richelieu, /The Political Testament of Cardinal Richelieu/, chapter II (1642)

** Competing Ideas
Monday, 22 August, 2022

“Science is a process for learning about nature in which competing ideas about how the world works are measured against observations.”—Richard Feynman, /The Meaning of it All/

** A Time for Peace and a Time for War
Friday, 15 July, 2022

“It is as much a crime to disturb the peace when truth prevails as it is a crime to keep the peace when truth is violated. There is therefore a time in which peace is justified and another time when it is not justifiable. For it is written that there is a time for peace and a time for war and it it the law of truth that distinguishes the two. But at no time is there a time for truth and a time for error, for it is written that God’s truth shall abide forever. That is why Christ has said that He has come to bring peace and at the same time that He has come to bring the sword. But He does not say that He has come to bring both the truth and the falsehood.”—Blaise Pascal, /Pensées/ #974

** Scholar to a Fool
Friday, 08 July, 2022

“If anyone makes himself his own master in the spiritual life, he makes himself scholar to a fool”—St Bernard

** The Night They Arrived, June 22, 1990
Friday, 08 July, 2022

“That was the night they arrived. Remember the shooting star? That was them. Nothing happened at first. They were getting ready, burrowing in underground, preparing. Not long after you lot left, people started to change. One or two at first, then more. They replaced people of influence, taking over the institutions, remaking, remodelling, refurbishing. Doing everything they could to make us join them.”—Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, /The World’s End/

** This is Water
Friday, 08 July, 2022

“Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure, and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already—it’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.”—David Foster Wallace, /Kenyon College Commencement/, May 21, 2005

** Law of Liberty
Monday, 04 July, 2022

“The Gospel is a Law of Liberty. We are treated as sons, not as servants; not subjected to a code of formal commandments, but addressed as those who love God, and wish to please Him.”—John Henry Cardinal Newman, /Tracts of the Times No. 8/

** Feeding Christians
Wednesday, 25 May, 2022

“If we elaborate the Pauline analogy of balanced ascetical dietetics we can think of four stages: milk, gravy, vegetables, beefsteak in infant to manhood diet. There is no need to linger over the arrangement of these in any hierarchy of value, since all are needed equally by the mature adult. Nevertheless, there is a hierarchy of grade by way of digestibility. We cannot, that is to say, call beefsteak better than milk, but beefsteak /is/ only usable and digestible by adults. We are, then, faced with something rather frightening. We have a full synthesis of agreement between such seemingly diverse schools of religious thought as St Ignatius Loyola and Professor James Ward; the one medieval, ascetic—even in the idiomatic sense—and Catholic; the other modern, ethical-humanist and Protestant. These agree, but their agreed conclusion is categorically opposed to the general consensus of pastoral practice.

“This synthesis gives us a clear-cut order of development stage by stage: (i) the “first form of contemplation”, or “natural” contemplation, then (ii) meditative prayer, then (iii) vocal prayer, then (iv) corporate worship. Yet at the first stirrings of religion in the modern soul, the religious birth of a babe in Christ, at the very first stirring of spiritual consciousness, such a soul—irrespective of physical age, which might be anything from 4 to 90—is told brusquely to go to church. This implies corporate worship (iv), raw beefsteak to the newborn child. After which the child-soul is told to say his prayers (iii)—boiled potatoes; and all the time meditation (ii) is fit only for the very advanced—light gruel for the adult stevedore; and admitting the ambiguity of the term contemplation, words like Recollection, purgation, humility, and consecration are the very last thing in advanced technique. The whole order, by some Satanic twist, is exactly reversed.”—Martin Thornton, /Pastoral Theology: A Reorientation/, p. 189

** Being a Christian
Tuesday, 17 May, 2022

“It is almost universally assumed to-day that becoming a Christian means in essence the adoption of a new set of beliefs or the initiation of a new mode of behaviour. A Christian would be defined as one who “believes in Christ” or “worships Christ” or “tries to follow Christ’s teaching.” Now it is far from my purpose to belittle either Christian dogma or Christian ethics. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that to define the essence of Christianity in terms either of belief or of practice involves the neglect of two principles that are fundamental to all sound theology. The former of these is that the act of God precedes and is presupposed by the acts of man: “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us” (1 John iv. 10), “Ye have come to know God, /or rather to be known of God/.” (Gal. iv. 9) The second is that what a being /is/ precedes what it /does/; our actions are a consequence of what we are, /operari sequitur esse/. It will follow from this that the Christian should be defined not in terms of what he himself does, but of what God has made him to be. Being a Christian is an ontological fact, resulting from an act of God.”—E.L. Mascall, /Christ, the Christian, and the Church/, p. 77

** Throw him down
Sunday, 15 May, 2022

“If thou seest a young man ascending up to heaven by his own will, catch him by the foot and throw him down, for it is not expedient for him.”—Abbot Lucius, seen in Fr. Martin Thornton, /Pastoral Theology: A Reorientation/, p. 77

** Compounding Error
Monday, 28 March, 2022

“If there is something very slightly wrong in our definition of the theories, then the full
mathematical rigor may convert these errors into ridiculous conclusions.”—Richard P.
Feynman.

** Roots
Thursday, 24 March, 2022

“A plant severed from its roots is more likely to attract parasites than to bear fruit. There is no substitute for direct connections with the past.”—David Kucharsky, /The Man from Plains/, p. 116

** Truth
Thursday, 24 March, 2022

“Bonaventure would see truth primarily as an attribute of God—“I /am/ the Truth”— and so as lovable, in itself, as the inherent virtues of a beloved person. A man can be said to love, not only his wife, but her faithfulness, sense of humour, good temper, or any other characteristic. The truth, therefore, whether scientific, personal, or theological, is lovable as part of God; to live in the truth is, in part at least, union with God. Dishonesty is rejection of divine love, and almost a marring of his beauty; it is not only immoral but ugly.”—Fr. Martin Thornton, /English Spirituality/, p. 124

** Trinity
Thursday, 10 March, 2022

“The doctrine of the Trinity, far from being merely academic, is the expression of the most fundamental human experience, and, we shall see later, it is of much practical use. Only the view that God is transcendent, majestic, almighty, the creator of the universe and standing outside it, can fully satisfy the human mind. Yet we know that he must also be immanent—in the world, close to us, giving us life; "in him we live, and move, and have our being." This is an absurd contradiction without the mediation of the second Person of the Trinity. The experience is common to all men, though only the Christian revelation adequately expresses it, and that is why the idea is hinted at, groped after, throughout the Old Testament: Jehovah—the God of all, the Messiah—his anointed, and the indwelling Wisdom.”—Fr. Martin Thornton, /Christian Proficiency/, p. 6

** God as I Understand God
Sunday, 06 March, 2022

“We can never attain to a completely synthetic view of what God has revealed Himself to be. For that would involve a level of unified knowledge which can belong to none but to God Himself. Such a simple and simultaneous knowledge of what God is must exist in God Himself. But we on our part must be content to approach the sanctuary from the outside and from a number of different points of view.”—L.S. Thornton, “The Christian Conception of God”: /Essays Catholic and Critical/, p. 126.

** Spirituality
Monday, 28 February, 2022

“It must also be remembered that  “spirituality” is the totality of Christian life guided by prayer. There is thus a sense in which all decisions and factors of human life come under the influence of  “spiritual” guidance. On the other hand, spiritual guidance should be firmly limited to the development of the controlling prayer; it must consist in  “counsel” not  “advice”. That is the Caroline position, in which all moral decisions in a recollective life depend on a well-trained conscience: the conscience is trained by spiritual direction, but it is that conscience, not the director, which makes its own practical decision in daily life.”—Fr. Martin Thornton, /English Spirituality/, Chapter 22

** Emergencies
Monday, 22 February, 2022

“‘Emergencies’ have always been the pretext on which the safeguards of individual liberty have been eroded—and once they are suspended it is not difficult for anyone who has assumed such emergency powers to see to it that the emergency will persist.”——F. A. Hayek, /Law, Legislation, and Liberty/

** Class Warfare
Monday, 22 February, 2022 (2/22/22)

“I have no particular love for the idealized ‘worker’ as he appears in the bourgeois Communist’s mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.”—George Orwell (in /Homage to Catalonia/, Chapter 10)

** PR
Sunday, 13 February, 2022

“Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed. Everything else is public relations.”—George Orwell — maybe, I can’t find a source — or maybe this:

“News is something somebody doesn’t want printed; all else is advertising.”—William Randolph Hearst — maybe, or maybe Lord Northcliffe (Alfred Harmsworth). Or maybe a whole [[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/20/news-suppress/][raft of others]].

Orwell seems to be joining Winston Churchill, Mark Twain, the Dalhi Lama, Dr. King and Albert Einstein as the go-to attribution for anything at all. Just remember that Abe Lincoln said, “You can’t trust anything you see on the Internet.” Or my Grandma Smith, “The paper holds still and you can write anything you want on it.”

At any rate, I’d say that there’s an awful lot of PR and advertising in the “newspapers” these days and precious little news/journalism. But that’s just my opinion, your mileage may vary.

** The Truth
Saturday, 22 January, 2022

“Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may resent it. Ignorance may deride it. Malice may distort it. But there it is.”—Winston Churchill, speech to the House of Commons, May 17, 1916

** Second-hand
Sunday, 16 January, 2022

“In religion and politics people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing.”—Mark Twain, Autobiographical dictation, 10 July 1908. Published in /Autobiography of Mark Twain/, Volume 3 (University of California Press, 2015)

** All lies
Sunday, 16 January, 2022

“I have recently concluded that many people who accept or oppose the vast tapestry of lies within which we now exist, the closing down of freedom and the rise of a new totalitarianism, have in a strange way unknowingly embraced a trick of the propagandists: they have become so one-dimensional in their obsessive need to defend or oppose their positions that they have forgotten to relish life.”—Edward Curtain, [[https://off-guardian.org/2022/01/16/communing-with-camus-in-2022/][/Communing with Camus in 2022/]]

** Irrelevance
Sunday, 16 January, 2022

“The strange superstition has arisen in the Western world that we can start all over again, remaking human nature, human society, and the possibilities of happiness; as though the knowledge and experience of our ancestors were now entirely irrelevant.”—Sir Roger Scruton, /Becoming a Family/, [[https://www.city-journal.org/html/becoming-family-11806.html][City Journal]], Spring, 2001

** Certainty
Tuesday, 11 January, 2022

“If you thought that science was certain — well, that is just an error on your part.”—Richard P. Feynman, /The Quotable Feynman/, p. 349, Princeton University Press

** Spiritual Poverty
Tuesday, 04 January, 2022

“For conservatives have long understood that free markets and political liberty go together. What if it turned out that free markets plus the cultural revolution of the Sixties added up to spiritual poverty and political exploitation?”—[[https://spectatorworld.com/topic/institutionalized-long-march-marcuse-sixties-revolution/][Roger Kimball]]

** Power
Saturday, 01 January, 2022

“Power concedes nothing without demand. It never did and it never will.”—Frederick Douglass
