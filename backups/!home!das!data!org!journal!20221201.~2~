** 06:34 Welcome to December.
** 10:03 Copying backups to the 2TB external. V at therapy. Delicate laundry in progress. Plan a shower soon. Sent a text to the sibs saying no obligation to have a big event when Ans comes. Barb is dealing with Dean, Nancy is going to visit Sarah, and Rob and Cathy may be planning to be at the cabin.
** 10:51 Screen froze at some point, just rebooted. Might have tried to stack too many file copies in “thunar” - copying to the 2TB. Will try again more slowly.
** 14:40 Finished copying backups to removable media, installed mate environment to try to replace xfce. If I don’t like it, I’ll remove xfce and reinstall it. Maybe it will run for years again before it starts to screw up.
** 14:56 Mate seems to work OK. Will take time to get it all lined up, but it’s basically working.
** 22:38 Removed Mate utterly, to the best of my ability. Logged in as david and found that the screen didn’t blank. Compared that xfce power config file with das’ and found one extra line in das’. I’ve just edited that out and rebooted. Maybe that will help.
** 22:50 Didn’t help.
** 22:50 Will keep looking. There’s something about how david is configured that is different in a way that makes a difference.

** 10:48 Created new user “alan” - no screen blanking. Researched at length, don’t think that xfce-power is the source, and xscreensaver isn’t installed, but there is something weird. Anyway, I deleted all of the contents of .config/xfce4 after copying to data, and rebooted. Things seem to run OK, will have to reconfig thunar and shell and panels, but it might be worth it if the screen blanking thing is fixed. I need to now go away for 5-10-15 minutes and see what happens. I guess I should do stim and exercises.
** 11:07 Screensaver of some sort activated - looks like 15 minutes. I’m going to try logging into alan again and giving it more time.
** 11:42 All this time in “alan” and no blanking. Looks to me like the thing to do is to backup /home/das/*, list all “das” characteristics (userno, groups, etc), then delete das, reboot, and recreate das with those characteristics (so as not to have to update all the file ownerships everywhere). A little research to be done first.
** 12:54 Old das is gone, new das exists, seems to have access to old das’ files. Emacs is working now - started with just copying init.el and early-init.el into .emacs.d and fired ‘er up. Had to copy a few .el files over, but it seems to be working now. Will be a bit shy about starting elfeed and mu4e up until I’m sure that all the supporting dot files are in place. I think I’ll work on getting Brave configured next by copying over the .config folder.
** 13:17 copied over several config folders beside Brave - GnuCash, calibre, geegie, that sort of thing. Hope none of them trigger the screensave. For that matter, I haven’t left this alone to see whether it’s ok now. Probably should sooner rather than later.
** 17:28 It was going to screensaver, but only because that’s the default behavior. I reconfigured the power app and it seems to be fine now. Salmon, fries and fried cabbage for dinner.
** 22:04 Just bought Jesse’s gifts - a bird bath from Amazon and a gift card from Image Comics - total $100.
** 22:45 Off to bed now. Updated Brave and Chrome-Stable.

** 10:11 Zoom was weird this morning - mostly video - and read that the only known cure was completely removing it, rebooting and reinstalling. Which I did, and will do (reboot) now.
** 10:38 Rebooted, haven’t installed Zoom yet. Need to get our Part D changes done today or tomorrow. Next week I may be caught-up in Jury Duty - or maybe not. They may not need me.
** 11:03 And the screen blanked and locked. Reset just now to not lock, but the setting was to not blank at any time, so wha?
** 11:45 Played with Zoom - display settings includes the ability to rotate my image by 90 degrees. Doing that seems to have fixed the green flashing. We’ll see if that sticks. Screen blanking still happens - I set it from “never” to “60 minutes” and we’ll see if it listens to that. Sophia just came by and I fixed her toast. She’s chatting with V now.
** 12:13 Screen blanked in a lot less than an hour. It’s completely ignoring the xfce power config. I’m sure that somewhere in the logs it’ll tell me what else is doing this - xscreensaver, perhaps?
** 13:49 Well, we do both have new Part D coverage. Much less expensive for her, a few hundred less for me. We’ll be looking for a source of 1% ivermectin cream for her - will probably need to get it from a vet source like a farm store.
** 22:24 Saw the movie “Passing” with Nancy and Rick, then had dinner at our house, Chinese and pizza. They left not too long ago. V is talking to Craig, then we’ll do EP. A new copy of Thornton’s Prayer arrived today, as did Adam’s REI gift card.

** 18:30 Just learned that I will be going to the Courthouse tomorrow at 0830. Had salmon salad and cole slaw for dinner. Began transcribing Thornton’s Margery Kempe book this morning. Bought gifts for Jackie, Finn and Graham today, so we’re 90% done. All I have for V is the calendar, and we need to find something to give Ans that she can carry home. Worked on the back bedroom - reorganized part of the office. A pretty good day’s work, all in all.

** 08:55 V woke with a sore throat - I announced sickness and am not at Court. Will leave soon to get more tests at Walgreens and go to Aldi. Then plan to bake bread. V tested and is negative for Covid so far.
** 14:59 Bread is out of the oven, and so is granola. Doing both at the same time is sub-optimal. I had to raise the loaves in the pans on top of the stove, quite warm due to the 350F oven baking the granola. Then the loaves and granola coexisted in the oven. Both are cooling off now. V is talking with Ans now. We moved ahead with the curtains in the guest bedroom - both the closet door and the window. We have brackets that will work with the window blinds, so that’s a help. We’re doing OK for getting ready in two weeks. The Court will call me to jury duty again sometime next Spring.
** 21:25 Got Ans’ itinerary, bought V a silk skirt and shearling moccasins.

** 12:19 V decided to use the small artificial tree rather than spend $95 for a live 6’ tree. I got the box out of the crawl space, set up the larger artificial tree on the deck, got the wreath out and put the boxes and the wreath bag back into the crawl space. Got the three audio files for the Rule Retreat downloaded and transcribed. Might do the sermons, too. Saw that for both V and I, some of our meds are cheaper if bought locally than if through the mail-order. Printed the sheet and highlighted the best prices for each med.
** 17:04 Changed a few things in init.el - url for elpa is now http, not https, full emacs boots fast now. Removed all the modus-* theme packages and configured to use built-in modus-theme.

** 11:50 Fixed the new shelves on the R of the fireplace - both sides are the same now, not finished, but the same. Talked to Carl. Missed a call from Babkes office again. V is at Wegman’s. Ladder is waiting for me outside the garage at Mim’s. Time for lunch.
** 15:17 Got ladder from Mim and used the blower to clean the NE gutter. All the gutters are clean now. I may install a gutter guard there next Spring - that’s the only gutter that traps leaves. Bagges the leaves on the ground between the house and Bruce’s fence. Outdoors seems to be pretty well fixed for the winter.

** 18:24 Jingle Mingle was fun. Not too big a crowd, but enough and there was lots of food. We stayed to help clean up, I carried the trash to the dumper.
** 23:11 Messed with the kindle fire when it wouldn’t let me delete some old “samples” - removed the card, rebooted, deleted the few files that were on the device itself, got to having zero downloaded items, then deleted all files on the card and reinstalled. Seems to be working OK now. Won’t try to download all of the files now. I should have them all on calibre, anyway.

** 07:45 Joining the AA meeting late today...
** 11:28 3rd step was fixated on “spiritual, not religious” which always seems to become “attack the only outside issue we’re allowed to attack in AA, i.e., “organized religion”, i.e., Christianity. So I arrived five minutes late and stayed ten minutes. Showered, put Ans’ blanket out to air again. Updated kindle on Mac and will import into calibre on minos now. Al-Anon Zoom starts in 15. Just now rsync’d home to backup including .cache, lest I mess up XFCE again. For the moment it’s working reasonably well. May want to disable moving from workspace to workspace by mouse wheel on desktop. It’s too unreliable in the sense that it happens when I’m not expecting it to. Hope to visit RAC houses today - copied my Monday message to Mike to the rest of the RAC since there was no change in the apps.
** 15:43 Visited all of the RAC houses. Attached lights to the front of the deck. Moved keyboard tray to foot of the driveway.

Check with Ben’s people, then deposit this Sunday. Wrapped most of the gifts last night - may need to buy some bags for the little square toys. Hanging pictures in the hall a priority today. RAC tonight.
** 10:36 PT rescheduled to 12/19 at 1515. Wrote to Laura and Jeanne at Ben’s to try to find out whether the check to St Paul’s was cut and sent. I’m inclined to think not. V is at Giant getting mushrooms for Hunters’ Sauce. When she gets back I’ll head down to Dodge-Chrome to pick up the pictures.
** 11:44 Back with the prints - they look pretty nice. V is online with her therapist so I’ll stick in here for now.
** 15:43 V went to get a haircut, when she got back we hung pictures on the N side of the hall - mostly kids and group shots. Looks nice. Made Ans’ bed, and her room is about all ready.
** 18:51 Got things squared away with Ben’s - they’ll pull $3,500 back out of my checking, and the check has been sent to St. Paul’s. Ham, Harvard Beets and roast potatoes for dinner. Off to the RAC now.

Ordered a hardback copy of the Trent Catechism to go with the Kindle version and the newer Catholic Catechism. Also ordered a Kindle Baltimore Catechism. Setting myself up to do some comparison and study, since we new-style-old Anglicans seem to be lacking in systematic theology. What is it we believe, as if it is of foremost importance?

Will have to overcome the bios problem, of course, before I can boot from anything other than the current /.
** 13:42 Got a carload in house from the locker - luggage, some boxes. Decided to stick with Debian 11 for the time being, but it’s worth doing a fresh install instead of just tweaking the filesystem sizes. So let’s see how this goes. Hope to be back with you later tonight.
** 17:57 Newly installed minos debian 11 with the current emacs built and being configured. Something is wrong with the key mappings in journal - apparently there have been some "breaking changes" that weren't bumping me before now. Anyway, I'm getting things set up and working, there's a lot more space on / and not so much wasted space on /home. Don't have mu setup yet.
