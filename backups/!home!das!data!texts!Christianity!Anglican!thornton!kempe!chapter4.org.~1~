4 MARGERY AND THE SCHOOL OF ST VICTOR (1)

To the Victorines, “reading” means the symbolic interpretation of the created world. Basically, reading a book is looking at visible signs—letters and words— and searching for their inner or representative meaning. In the ascetical context of St Victor, the word is widened into a similar process applied to the whole phenomenal creation. It hints at the “divine visual language” of Berkeley, and it anticipates—although there are significant differences—the total sacramentalism of St Thomas Aquinas. This application, or ascetical view, of the doctrine of creation, this practical working out of the relations between Creator, creation, and mankind, is a central interest of the Victorine school. Perhaps there is some significance in the fact that Margery always refers to herself as “this creature”, not as a derogatory or humiliating term, but in the technical and sanely humble sense: as indicative of the plain distinction between the Creator and that which is created.

The Victorine “reading” is, therefore, what we should now call recollection in the world, and it is not far from the Thomist principle that all spirituality begins with “sense life” on the natural level and that this experience becomes supernaturalized by prayer and grace. Nor is it unlike the “remote preparation” of St Ignatius Loyola, although there is one very important difference here, which we must note later. it is this particular type of symbolism, this disciplined recollection-in-the-world, of which Margery is a master. To her, ordinary everyday things are real enough; she is certainly no idealist, but everything is a mirror of God. It is no crude “sign seeking”—although occasionally she may descend to this—nor is it the artificial recollection of a vague impersonal presence, which is so common today. There are occasions, of course, when Margery’s sense of union with our Lord is inclined to be spiritualistic or mystical, but much more often she exhibits a Christo-centrism where every ordinary daily event is seen recollected in, and reflected by, the sacred humanity:

... Wherever God is, Heaven is, and God is in thy soul, and many an angel is about thy soul, to keep it both day and night, for when thou go-est to church, I go with thee; when thou sittest at thy meat, I sit with thee; when thou go-est to bed, I go with thee; and when thou go-est out of town, I go with thee. (K., p. 40)

In this perpetual state of recollection, all things and all events act as spontaneous symbols which carry her straight to meditative communion with, and in, Christ. In accord with the general spirit of St Victor, the distinctions between sacred and secular, religion and life, science and theology, would have been quite meaningless to her. All children immediately remind her of the childhood of Christ (K., pp. 111, 264), mothers and babies remind her of the Blessed Virgin (K., p. 121). But it has to be a “man-child”: idealist symbolism will not do! She spontaneously thinks of our Lord and teh Apostles when the Abbot of Leicester approaches with his brethren (K., p. 152), wounded men carry her thoughts straight to the Passion and inspire her to make marvellous intercessory prayer (K., p. 232). Again the men are real and to be served just as Christ himself is real and to be adored: it is all the very reverse of unpractical pietism. Particular liturgical functions: Candlemass (K., p. 260), the purification of women (K., p. 261), and the Palm Sunday ceremonies (K., p. 245), carry her straight to the heart of the matter, straight to the real thing symbolized. Modern English Catholicism needs a constant reminder that this is, in fact, the whole point of the thing!

And sometimes, when she saw a crucifix, or if she saw a man with a wound, or a beard, whichever it were, of if a man had a child before here, or smote a horse or other beast with a whip, or if she saw it or heard it, she thought she saw Our Lord being beaten or wounded, just as she saw it in the man or the beast either in the field or the town, and by herself alone as well as amongst the people. (K., p. 88, cf. 226)

Nor does she stop at the Passion, nor at mere piety:
