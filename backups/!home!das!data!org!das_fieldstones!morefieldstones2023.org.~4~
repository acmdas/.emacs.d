** And the People...
Thursday, 12 January, 2023

“And the people shall oppress one another, yes, every man his neighbor. The child shall be bold toward the elder, and the base toward the honorable. ...Their very look bears witness against them; their sin like Sodom they vaunt, they hide it not. Woe to them! they deal out evil to themselves.”—Isaiah 3:5-9

** Vanity Fair
Friday, 27 January, 2023

“Many passengers stop to take their pleasure or make their profit in [Vanity] Fair, instead of going onward to the Celestial City. Indeed, such are the charms of the place that people often affirm it to be the true and only heaven, stoutly contending that there is no other, that those who seek further are mere dreamers, and that, if the fabled brightness of the Celestial City lay but a mere mile beyond the gates of Vanity, they would not be fools enough to go thither.

“...The Christian reader, if he have had no accounts of the city later than Bunyan’s time, will be surprised to hear that almost every street has its Church, and that the Reverend Clergy are nowhere held in higher respect than at Vanity Fair. And well do they deserve such honorable estimation; for the maxims of wisdom and virtue, which fall from their lips, come from as deep a spiritual source, and tend to us as lofty a religious aim, as those of the sagest philosophers of old.”—Nathaniel Hawthorne, “The Celestial Railroad”, found in Christopher Lasch, /The True and Only Heaven/, 1991.
