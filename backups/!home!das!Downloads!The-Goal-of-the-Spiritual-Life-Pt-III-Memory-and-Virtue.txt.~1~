When we embark on a life of prayer, our Lord is overjoyed, and the enemy is pretty nervous.
He doesn't like that.
The enemy cannot read your mind.
He doesn't know the future, but he does have particular access to your memory.
Memories are the devil's playground.
He can even remember things that you don't remember from your past and re-present them
to you, or cobble them together and put multiple images in your mind.
So this is a very common tactic that the devil uses in order to hinder our growth in intimacy
with Christ through mental prayer.
It can happen that as you embark on the life of recollection and mental prayer, that memories
of past injuries or injustices come to mind.
This is not the time to get embittered or think about plots of revenge, right?
This is our Lord showing us where we have to adequate our heart to His.
And maybe it's somebody that in our heart we've already forgiven.
But you know, our Lord told us we have to forgive seven times seventy, and you know
everybody says forgive and forget.
Well, nobody forgets.
That's not the idea.
That's not the idea to forget.
It's to purify our memory.
How do I remember these events, this person?
How do I, with the heart of Christ, with the eyes of Christ?
Or through the prism of human justice?
And I've dealt with people who have received a wound from somebody.
And you know, think of it like a dagger, and they hold on to it.
Instead of pulling it out and allowing it to be healed, they often hold on to it and
think about it.
Thomas Aquinas, you know, one of the greatest psychologists, he just knew the inner workings
of the mind and the heart of man.
He said that these people ultimately develop a certain joy in their sorrow.
It sounds schizophrenic, but he says they develop a certain joy in remembering these
things.
God spares from that.
So when our Lord says we have to forgive seven times seventy, that means as soon as those
faces, those events come bubbling up in my mind, Lord, you know I forgive that person.
I ask you to forgive that person, and forgive me for whatever part I had in it.
Thank you for hearing my prayer, and then we get on with it.
If I'm in prayer, and I have also crazy thoughts that have absolutely nothing to do with, they're
even morally neutral, just distractions, fine?
I don't get upset, I don't get worked up.
Sometimes it's the Holy Spirit, sometimes it's the devil, sometimes it's just my own
inability to be focused.
Whatever the case, in whatever the provenance, it's not a reason to get upset.
If we get discouraged, discouragement is a sign of vanity, it's because I'm not living
up to the caricature I had of myself, or what I would like to be.
So discouragement has absolutely no role in the life of a follower of Christ.
When I have memories, when I have unwilled distractions, what do I do?
Well, first, instead of getting upset, instead of violently trying to go back to, I'm not
going to think about that, I'm not going to think about that, just all I do is I'm thinking
about that.
Well, that's not helpful, I shouldn't lose my recollection, I acknowledge that.
Lord, this memory or this distraction came to me, and I know you will possess me the
more I have, the more I grow in my own self-possession.
In other words, these memories, these distractions, that's part of who I am, it's not a problem
for Christ, therefore it shouldn't be a problem for me, that's part of who I am.
When our Lord calls us to prayer, He calls us as we are, with our pre-packaged foibles,
with our history, with our past sins, our past virtues, our present weakness, our present
grace, all of these things, and that's just part of the deal of having a relationship.
We're not a defect attached to a person.
All of these things are not obstacles for our Lord, and it's important to remember too
that we can do nothing to make Him love us more.
We can't do anything to make Him love us more, or less.
He's not going to stop loving us, He's not going to say, well now I actually do love
you because you jumped through my hoops, well, no.
He loves us for better and for worse.
Whether He's pleased by us, that's another issue.
But here, what we're talking about is how to deal with memories and distractions in
the time of prayer.
When I have these things come bubbling up to the surface in my prayer, or even throughout
the day, after I acknowledge them, I place them in the context of Jesus Christ, in the
context of His heart.
I have to be honest with myself about them, and whatever thoughts come my way, and I place
them before Him.
Lord, this came up, I'm not sure if it's from you, from the devil, from myself, I place
it in your heart nonetheless.
There is an abyss between recognizing these things and placing them in the context of
Jesus Christ, making Him the context.
That's very, very healing.
And then I accept what He says about it, and this means I have to really have an existential
openness to Him.
I have to be receptive.
I have to learn to listen, be honest with Him, be honest with myself.
And this is the most fruitful, proactive exercise of receptivity.
Benedict XVI says, To receive from God, always expressed in prayer, is the truth of the human
creature, who on the one hand experiences weakness and impoverishment, therefore addresses
his supplication to heaven, and on the other hand is endowed with an extraordinary dignity,
so that in preparing to receive divine revelation, finds himself able to enter into communion
with God.
So all of these foibles, all of these things that can occur to us, are not problems for
our Lord, and therefore they shouldn't be problems for us.
I had a friend who was a medical doctor, a missionary doctor, he worked in India, he
worked in China, and then he found that God, in the hectic work that he was doing, he found
that our Lord, he'd go on the roof of the hospital, he'd go for his breaks and smoke
his cigarettes, and there in the silence, looking up at the stars, he felt a call to
solitude and he became a hermit, he was a lay hermit living in the woods up in New Brunswick.
And he became an incredible scripture scholar, an authority, because of his facility with
the ancient languages.
He was telling me one time, when he was in India, he remembers getting off the train,
all of the beggars were there, and they were like, trying to get their attention, they
were knocking on their, pulling on their sleeve, asking, screaming, crying, pleading, and he
said, and then there was this little girl, maybe three years old, just sitting there
with a bowl, not saying anything, and he said, when I saw her I understood what prayer is,
this absolute receptivity, just trusting that something will come my way, not thinking I
have to plead, not thinking I have to get God's attention, but being absolutely open
and receptive, and when our Lord, when we've placed him in his context, and we are receptive
to what he has to say about it, we ought to respond, so when our Lord accepts these things
from us, there's a responsibility we're endowed with, the responsibility to respond, and this
is not something that we simply do with our own strength, if he is asking us to do something
with us, he also gives us the grace to do it, the grace to forgive, the grace to integrate
these thoughts into my relationship with him, so that they can be purified, you know, he
says apart from me you can do nothing, and so this is something that also will require
his grace.
The Catechism of the Catholic Church in Canon 2705, it says, meditation is above all a quest,
the mind seeks to understand why, the why and how of Christian life, in order to hear
it and respond to what the Lord is asking.
Now when John of the Cross speaks about the faculties, whether it's the will, the intellect,
or the memory, he attributes a particular theological virtue to each one of those faculties.
We've misused all of those faculties, we've had disordered affections for things, in other
words we've misused our will, we've had disordered intellect by thinking of the wrong things,
and our ability to remember things outside of the context of the heart of Christ is also
a spiritual problem, but not without a solution.
So it's precisely the theological virtues that you exercise of the theological virtues
that are going to purify those corresponding faculties.
The intellect is purified by faith, the will is purified by charity, and the memory is
purified by hope.
What is hope?
Hope is a promise made by our Lord that regards a future fulfillment.
If faith is the belief in invisible but present realities, hope regards something that is
not yet fulfilled.
We can make a mistake, you remember the old Palmolive commercial, you know you're soaking
in it?
We sometimes think of heaven as something far off from the future, and nonetheless we're
soaking in it, we're immersed, you know, what did our Lord call Saint Faustina's heart?
He said, your heart is my heaven on earth, because there I rest and I find no resistance.
So our Lord is calling us to begin our eternal life now, but it hasn't reached a definitive
fulfillment, and that's why we have the virtue of hope.
Hope then is anchored in the past with this promise that he made, and so we're anchored
in the past but we're stretching towards the future, and this means that there's a healthy
but necessary tension, we're being stretched.
When we exercise hope, that puts our past and our present in the context of the future.
So this is where our memory then is purified by this theological virtue.
Remember it's a virtue, which means we have to act on it, it has to become a habit.
They're called theological because they are not like the natural or even the other infused
virtues that we have, such as courage.
Courage is justice, fortitude, prudence, these were recognized by pagans as natural virtues.
When you're baptized, all of a sudden those natural virtues are infused and they become
supernatural.
Courage does not degree, it's a substantial difference.
But all of those virtues have to be moderated.
Think of the example of courage.
Courage has to be moderated.
If there's a defect, that's called wimpiness.
If there's excess, it's called foolhardiness.
In other words, if I'm paralyzed by fear, I fault against courage.
If I don't take into account the context, the situation, the dangers, and I'm oblivious
to it, that's called foolhardiness.
So notice that courage implies a certain fear, but it's not a fear that paralyzes.
It's a recognition of the dangers, but I'm not paralyzed by fear of this and that's the
virtue.
So notice it's moderated.
It's moderated by prudence.
Faith, hope, and charity do not permit moderation.
I mean if I tell our Lord, I believe 98% of everything you say, well that's a problem.
That's no longer a theological virtue.
I knew a man, I didn't know him, I knew his family.
As soon as his son was confirmed, he says, well I've done my duty, in five years I'm
leaving.
It's a little odd, you know, for a father of a family to say, in five years to the day
he left.
It was pretty weird.
But he already left when he made that choice.
He was no longer there interiorly.
In other words, when we're in a relationship with our Lord, we can't moderate our faith,
our hope, our charity.
They regard totality.
They imply everything.
That's what a relationship does.
It implies everything.
A relationship with our Lord.
So I mentioned, almost ad nauseam, how the devil has access to our memory.
That's the most physical part of the human mind.
In fact, when that part of the mind, the physical part of the brain, is injured, there are often
memory problems.
So there's a connection between the physical and the spiritual there in the brain.
Physical and the psychological.
The devil, since he has access to our memories, he wants to exploit them.
And this is why we need to have our memories healed than Christ can with his precious blood.
John Henry Newman, in his homily on the mental sufferings of Christ, said that our Lord refused
to drink the drugged wine on the cross so that he could have absolute clarity of mind.
Because he wanted to redeem our memories.
He wanted to redeem and he wanted to be awake and alert for all of it.
So notice the mysteries of the life and the death and passion of our Lord than our aspects
that have entered into, when we're baptized, they've entered into our life and they've
elevated them, they've been joined to him.
That's why Peter says in his second letter, chapter 1, verse 4, that we participate in
God's nature and it's through Jesus Christ.
So we've been adopted, we've been elevated, made children in the Son of God.
And therefore our work, our tears, our joys, all of these things have been redeemed by
our Lord, but even our memories.
So when these memories come back, we have to remember what he did and that he can continue
to purify these things, to heal them.
I knew a woman, very virtuous, prayerful woman.
She suffered horrible, horrible abuse at home.
And one day, decades later in adoration, in a certain sensual, mystical way, she was transported
to the worst of the abuse.
It was as if it were happening to her in that moment.
And she's on her back crying and she looks to her side and there's Christ crying with
her.
So what happened?
He was showing her that he was the context.
He was present during all of that calvary that she went through.
There's a world of multiple human freedoms all around us.
We can't control what other people do, the good and the bad, and we're sometimes on the
receiving end of the bad.
And these memories, these traumas, horrible things, maybe from our childhood or recently,
the devil wants to exploit them and use them as a hindrance to intimacy with him.
And so what do we do?
Well, remember what John Henry Newman said, recently canonized John Henry Newman, about
Christ's redeeming of our memories with his absolute clarity of his intellect.
And then also, remember the example of that woman who endured horrible suffering at home
at the hands of her father.
Christ is the context.
So what do we do?
When I have these bad memories of something that happened to me, something I saw, something
I experienced, prayerfully, I see Christ was present with me.
I see that Christ was present with me and he was the context.
In his sacred humanity, he was suffering in me.
He wasn't oblivious.
He wasn't just there gawking as an observer, suffering in me.
What did Christ say to Saul as he's going to Damascus?
So he didn't say, why are you persecuting my followers?
Why are you, why are you persecuting the church?
Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me, me, Jesus of Nazareth?
Jesus of Nazareth was suffering in his glorified, sacred humanity in heaven.
What Saul was doing to the Christians to imprison them.
Jesus of Nazareth was suffering in heaven, in his sacred humanity, what was happening
to this little girl.
So he was not just present, he was suffering with her, suffering for her.
He suffers with you in his sacred humanity.
He still has his human emotions in a perfect and glorified state, but he has emotions.
He has feelings.
So he suffers in us, he suffers with us.
How does this work?
Isn't God perfectly happy?
Yes.
Aren't the souls in heaven and the blessed angels happy?
Yes.
They have what's called intrinsic joy and it's immutable.
It doesn't change.
Intrinsic joy is beholding God and rejoicing in his perfections for who he is.
That is something that does not change.
In our own experience, that ought to be the source of our joy, God's perfection, his goodness.
Then I've got my own variable and by degree more or less participation in that and that
is an extrinsic joy, but it also is open to extrinsic sorrow.
So that's why we see Our Lady of La Salette weeping over the sins of humanity and nonetheless
perfectly joyful.
St. Teresa of Calcutta, right?
She had that intrinsic joy in contemplating Our Lord and nonetheless was in the dark night.
These are things on different levels, but all at the same time and not in conflict with
each other.
So Christ suffers in us, he suffers with us, he rejoices in us and rejoices in us.
Everything about us is important to him.
It's so important to understand that and so when the memories come back, we remember these
truths and we place them in his sacred heart, Lord, I ask you to wash my memories with your
precious blood.
You know them better than I do and I ask you to purify them.
I trust that you are acting, if you've given me this desire to have my memory purified,
I hope in you, I trust in you.
We place it in the sacred heart and we exercise whatever forgiveness we have to exercise and
we ask for forgiveness for whatever role we may have had in this and we ask him to heal
it and we trust that he does.
When Eve beheld the forbidden fruit, now we always say apple but it never says apple anywhere
in scripture.
In fact, Midrash says it was a fig.
It was beautiful to behold, it tasted good and she rejoiced in the knowledge it gave.
So notice this fractioning of her intellect, her senses and her ability to possess.
So there we see this fragmentation of the human psychology which is what leads us to
our sinful tendencies.
We can have tendencies to pride, tendencies to sensuality, tendencies to vanity or greed
and you know each one of us can say well I've signed up for all of those.
I see them all present and I've pretty much mastered those subjects so thank you.
Now, if we want to overcome these tendencies, it's most helpful if we remember the three
necessary means of salvation and by degree, sanctification, grace, prayer, virtue.
We've spoken about grace, we've spoken about prayer but I think it's nice to walk away
and have an idea but if the idea doesn't become act, then it's not even an idea because we
forget about it.
On your handouts, it would be good to define things so that you've got a standard to go
by in the area of grace.
What is your Eucharistic life look like?
Your frequency of mass during the week, is it seven days, is it three days?
Define it, do the most you can, write it out.
What are your days of adoration?
Define it and write it out.
What is the frequency of your confession?
It's helpful to have a penitential day, a day when you not only go to confession but
you also fast, you do other sacrifices on that penitential day.
What day is it going to be and how many times a month, once a month, twice a month, four
times a month, in other words, week in confession, what is it going to be?
Define it and stick with it and make of that day a day of extra prayer and penance.
You can pray the penitential songs, you can fast, take a cold shower, put little pebbles
in your shoes, do little uncomfortable things that will not harm your health and exercised
with moderation will be very healthy for you and very pleasing to our Lord.
But it's helpful if we have a program that's written out, all you got to do is fill in
the blanks and then that's the easy part and then you do it.
That's not always so easy.
But if you have it written out, it's more likely to happen in the area of prayer, mental
prayer.
How long is it going to be?
Well, remember, I already said if you don't have the habit, start with 10 minutes a day
and then after two weeks, 20 and then after a month, 30.
What time am I going to do it and where do I do it?
Have it all figured out so you're not improvising.
Rosary, this ought to be a part of our daily program.
How many times has our lady appeared and asked for us to pray the rosary?
Think of tithing, right?
Every Catholic is obliged to give 10% of their earnings to the church.
Well, think of tithing of your time.
This is how we give God back the time that he gave us.
He gave you 24 hours a day, so 10%.
Private devotions, what kind of private devotions, right?
It's good to have, you know, who's your patron saint, who are your favorite saints, who are
the ones that you want to have your back and figure out what prayers you're going to say
to them.
Habit is important, constancy is important.
Now in the area of virtue, this is where it gets really interesting because we've got
to figure out what our dominant fault is.
In other words, if I could think of the most important dominant hindrance to holiness in
general terms, what would it be?
Is it pride?
Is it vanity, greed?
Is it sensuality?
If I'm somebody who tends towards laziness, I don't do what I have to do or I put off
important things because they're not enjoyable, well, that's sensuality, right?
I'm allowing this internal inertia to kind of drag me down.
I live by the life of the senses, what's pleasing, what's not pleasing.
That's the determining factor, not what gives God glory if you're doing His will.
If I'm, you know, if I find my mind often thinks about what I think others are thinking
about me, how I appear, I want to have this and this, you know, if I can buy this thing
then I'll be happy, well, there's a lot of vanity in that.
And it's almost a hybrid of sensuality and pride because there is something external
about that and at the same time there's a self-exaltation at work.
Or is it pride when whatever I do I have to take into account my own self rather than
is this what you want, Lord?
The church gives us, right, when it calls us to prayer, ultimately that's something
that's going to help us overcome pride in a big way because when we go into our room
and we pray to God the Father alone where nobody sees us, it's very humbling.
When we give our alms, we allow these external things to no longer have a hold on us.
And when we fast, we're making ourselves more available, open to our Lord because food no
longer has this claim on my heart.
So it's important to figure out which is my dominant fault.
Maybe I see vestiges of all three of them and that's usually the case, but what's the
dominant one?
If you could overcome one, the most important one, what would that be?
Figure it out, ask yourself and then mark it down.
And what are five manifestations of that dominant fault?
If I've set a sensuality, maybe I sleep in, maybe I eat too much, maybe I'm lazy, I binge
watch or whatever, I'm allowing my life to be dominated by the life of the senses.
I listen to too much music, I watch too much TV, I look at things no one should look at.
These are manifestations of sensuality.
Figure out the five, five just five, five manifestations of that one fault.
Make sure it's very concentrated.
You write it down there on the left column.
On the right column, you're going to write out your response to counter virtue, to degrade
that vice.
Psychologists tell us that it takes three weeks to degrade a vice and another three
weeks to learn a virtue in its place.
That's why the Church has always given us these six weeks of Lent.
So if I'm addicted to my phone, that's part of my sensuality.
I'm going to write that as one of the manifestations of my sensuality.
I'm going to say, okay, I can check emails once in the morning and once in the evening
and for utripaleia, utripaleia is the virtue of ordered recreation, ordered recreation.
And it's important.
It's an important part of our psychological balance, but it has to be ordered.
That means I put limits, it's moderated.
Few countries like America take entertainment and recreation as seriously as we do.
Serious business, you know, my hobbies.
Well, these things have to be reined in.
So how long do I allow myself screen time?
How long do I allow myself to, you know, watch the news or listen to music?
I have to put a limit there, make sure that this is something that is moderated.
If I have a hard time getting up in the morning and I've slept enough to recover, as soon
as my alarm goes off, I jump.
There's a huge difference between figuring out while I'm in bed when I'm going to get
up and knowing it's time to get up and getting up.
Our day turns out much different the way we attack the day.
It's going to be much more proactive, much more fruitful, and in a certain sense, when
we have this first act of self dominion, that sets a tone for the day so that we can live
like true followers of Christ who are very disciplined.
If I eat too much, well, then I'm going to determine what's enough, and I'm going to
have fast days.
I have to have established fast days.
In my community, the St. Veronica Giuliani community, we have members who in ordinary
time fast two days a week, in Advent, three days a week, and in Lent, six days a week.
What does that look like?
It's just one meal.
We have a zero mortality rate, okay?
Nobody has died yet from fasting six days a week and then on Sunday, or feast days,
allowing themselves more than one meal.
Your metabolism adjusts.
It goes into survival mode when you start storing everything.
So it's not dieting, okay?
It's not dieting.
It's an offering to our Lord.
When we recognize the manifestations, in other words, the concrete lived out manifestation
of that dominant fault, and then I find a corresponding response to put that thing,
to reign it in, to put it in order, I've got the material for what's called in Catholic
tradition a particular exam.
As opposed to a conscious exam is when I look at my global day.
What I did, what I didn't do, what I thought, what I said, what I didn't say, all of these
things.
That's just a look at my day in the light of God, asking Him pardon for anything that
was offensive, thanking Him for His blessings, etc.
That's just a conscious exam.
We should all do that.
It's very healthy before we go to bed, and certainly before confession.
But when we have, as Catholic tradition gives us, this particular exam, and we're focused,
I'm looking at it in my conscious exam time, I'm looking at it daily, I'm looking at it
before I go to confession, and I'm working on these points.
There's progress.
There's progress.
There has to be progress.
We're not set up for failure.
So our Lord, with His grace, and with our part in prayer, and our part in degrading
vices and learning virtues, what happens?
What's the result?
The result is holiness.
When our Lord said, be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect, this is what He's talking
about.
Our life of grace, our life of prayer, our life of virtue.
And that's why people are canonized.
Not because of their visions, not because of their stigmata, not because of their bilocations
and levitations.
It's because of these ordinary means of salvation, and by degree, holiness.
